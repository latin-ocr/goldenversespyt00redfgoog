ras, who in this only spread the doctrine which he hed
received at Tyre, at Memphis, and at Babylon· This
doctrine was thet of the Indians. One finds still today
among the Burmans, the division of all the created beings
established in three classes, each oi which contains a certain
number of species, from the material beings to the spiritual,
from the sentient to the intelligible.⁶ The Brahmans‚
who count fifteen spheres in the universe,⁶ appear to
unite the three primordial worlds with the twelve concentric
spheres which result from their development. Zoroaster,
who admitted the dogma of the three worlds, limited the
inferior world to the vortex oi the moon. There, according
to him, the empire of evil and oi matter comes to an end!
This idea thus conceived hasbeen general; it was that oi
all the ancient philosophers‘; and what is very remarkable,
is that it has been adopted by the Christian theosophists
who certainly were not sufficiently learned to act through
imitation! The followers of Basil, those of Valentine,
and all the gnostics have imbibed from this source the
system oi emanations which has enjoyed such a great re·

Egypt, Arabia, and Babylon, in which last city he remained twelve years.

Plutarch, Zaretas; and Theodoret, Zaradas. (Porphyr., virt Pythog.) Plu·
tarch is inclined to believe that this magian is the seme asZardusht, or Zoro-
aster, and the chronology is not here entirely contrary. (Plutar, De Procrect.
