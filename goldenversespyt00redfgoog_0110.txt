The Essence and Form of Poetry 87

Those who have made blank verse in French have
spoken justly of it with the greatest contempt; these verses,
miserable as to substance, without poetic fire, written as the
flattest prose, lacking movement and grace, had, further·
more, the insupportable fault of not recognizing the genius
of the French tongue, by making finals of the same kind
clash constantly, and by not distinguishing that which is
called rhyme from that which repels it.

Now that I have made as clear as possible my motives
and my means, there remains only, Messieurs, forme to
submit to your judgment the translation that I have made,
in eumolpique verse, of the piece of Greek poetry which
comprises the doctrine of Pythagoras in seventy·one lines
called, per excellence, Golden Verses. This piece, venerable
by its antiquity and by the celebrated philosopher whose
name it bears, belonging to eumolpoeia, without any mixture
of passion, is sufficiently known to savants so that Ι need
not speak about what concems its particular men't. This
would mean, moreover, a matter of some explanations.
At any rate, I believe it advisable before passing to this
final subject, to give you certain examples ol the use of my
verses as applied to epopoeia, so that you may judge, since
they are in hands as incapable as mine, what they might
become when used by men of superior genius and talent.
I will choose, for this purpose, the exposition and invocation
of the principal epic poems of Europe, in order to have a
fixed subject for comparison. 1 will translate line by line,
and will imitate, as well as is possible for me, the movement
and harmony of the poet that I may have before me. This
labour, which Ι hope will not be without some interest for
the illustrious academicians whom l arn addressing, will
fumish me the occasion of showing by certain characteristic
traits the genius of the language and poetry of the different
modern peoples of Europe; and Ι will terminate thus the
outline that I have sketched touching the poetic conditions
of the principal nations ol the carth.
