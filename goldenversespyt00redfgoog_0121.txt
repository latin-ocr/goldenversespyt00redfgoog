98 ‘she Golden Verses of Pythagoras

I recall having sometimes read French writers who,
not having investigated the character of their tongue, have
reproached it for its feminine syllables and have believed
that their concurrence was harmful to its force and its har-
mony. These writers have scarcely considered what this
language would be, deprived of its feminine sounds. For
with the little force that it would gain on one side. it would
acquire such a harshness on the other, that it would be
impossible to draw from it four consecutive lines that would
be endurable. If all its finals were masculine, and if nothing
could change it otherwise, it would be necessary to renounce
poetry, or like the Arabs, be resolved to composa whole
poems in the same rhyme.

We have just seen that the lack of masculine finals
takes away all energy from the Italian tongue; a contrary
defect would deprive the French of this melonge of sweet-
ness and force which makes it the premifre longua of
Europe. The English language is lacking in precisely
what the writers of whom I have spoken desired elimi-
nated from the French, without foreseeing the grave
disadvantages of their desire: it has no feminine finals¹;

mandi, which could not be without altering the sense entirely. Marehetti
has translated into blank verse the Latin poem of Lucretius. 1 will quote the
opening lines. Here is evident the softness to which I take exception and
which prevents them from being really eumolpique‚ according to the sense
that I have attached to tlfis word.

Almo figlio di Giovc, indito madre
Del gron geme d’Em, Venere bolla,
Degli nomini pinam e dagli Dei:

Tu, che sotto il volubili e lucenti

Segni del ciclo, il mor motando, e tutto
D'onimoi d'ogni specie omi lo terro:

. . . etc.

¹ One must not believe that the mute e with which many English words
terminate represents the French feminine final, expressed by the same vowel.
This mute eisin reality mute in English; ordinarily it is only used to give a
more open sound to the vowel which precedes it, as in tole, soene, bone, pure,
