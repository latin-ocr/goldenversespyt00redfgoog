25² The Golden Verses of Pythagoras

I must say, however, that it is upon the homogeneity of
Nature that were founded in the principle all the so-called
occult sciences of which the principal four, rdating to the
human Quaternary, were Theurgy, Astrology, Magio, and
Chemistry.⁰ 1 have already spoken of the astrologica]
science, and I have given sufficient evidence of what I think
regarding the ridiculous and petty ideas concerning it that
the moderns have coneeived. I will refrain from speaking
of the other three, on account of the prolixities into which
the discussions that they would provoke might lure me.
In another work I will endeavour to show that the principles
upon which they were supported differed greatly from those
which superstition and blind credulity have given them in
times of ignorance, and that the sciences taught to the ini·
tiates in the ancient sanctuaries, under the names of Theurgy‚
Magic, or Chemistry, differed much from what the vulgar
have understood in later times by the same words.

29. So thot, as to thy true rights enlightened,
Τ hine heart shall no more seed on eoin derives.

That is to say, that the disciple of Pythagoras, having
attained through knowledge of himself to that of truth,
ought to judge sanely of the possibility or impossibility of
things, and to find in wisdom itself that just mean which he
has found in virtue and in science. Equally distant from
that blind credulity which admits and seeks without reflec-
tion the things most incompatible with the laws of Nature,
and from that presumptuous ignorance which rejects and
denies without examination all those things which issue from

Thoth himself. Kn'gsmann, who assures us that this table must have read
in Phoenician and not in Greek, quotes it a little differently from what one
reads in the ordinary versions. Voyez Tabula Smomgds'no, citee par Fabric,
