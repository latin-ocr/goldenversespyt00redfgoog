³4 The Golden Verses ol Pythagoras

themselves, at long intervals, upon the scene of ὼε world
to enlighten it, shining in the depths of centurias and sarving
as torchas lor mankind. In whatever clime, in whatever

career destiny had placed him, he would have been the
foremost. Ever the same, whether under the thatched rool
or upon ὼε throne, as great in Egypt as in Graece, in the
Occident as in the Orient ol Asia, everywhere he had com-
manded admiration. Some centurias earlier this same attri-
bute might have been seen in Krishna or in Orpheus, some
centuries later, in Pythagoras or in Cyrus. Great men are
always great by their own greatness. Incidents which
depend upon chance can only modily. Homer was destined
to poetry by favourable circumstances. Born upon the
borders of the river Meles, ol an indigent mother, without
shelter and without ldndred, he owed, to a schoolmaster of
Smyrna who adopted him, his early erdstence and his early
instructions. He was at first called Melesigenes, from the
place ol his birth* Pupil ol Phemius, he received from

the object ol a host ol discussions as much among the ancients as among the
moderna. My plan here is not to put down again en probam, nor to ex-
amine anew the things which have been a hundred times dhoussed and that
1 have sufficiently examined. Ι have chosen, lrom the midst ol all the diver-
gent opinions bom ol these discussions, that which has appeared to me the
most probable, which agrees beat with known laets, and which is connected
better with the analytical thread ol my ideas. 1 advise my readers to do the
same. It is neither the birthplaoe of Homer nor the name of his parents that
is the important matter: it is his genius that must be lathomed. Those who
would, however, satisly their curiosity regarding these subjecta foreign to my
rasaarches, will find in Lo Bibliothtque graque de Fobas‘cs‘rsr, and in the book
by Leon Allatius entitled De Potrici Homeri, enough material lor all the systems
they may wish to build. They will find there twentysix different locatione
wherein they can, at their pleasure, place the cradle ol the poet. The seven
most famous places indicated in a Greek verse by Aulus Gellius are, Smyrna,
Rhodes, Colophon, Salamis, Chios, Argos, and Athens. The nineteen indi·
cated by divers authors, are Pylos, Chios, Cyprus, Clazomenae, Babylon,
Cumre, Egypt, Italy, Crete, Ithaca, Mycenae, Phrygia, Maeonia, Lucania,
Lydia, Syria, Thessaly, and finally Troy, and even Rome.

However, rba tradition which 1 have followed, in considering Homer as
born not lar lrorn Smyrna, upon the borders ol the river Melea, is not only
