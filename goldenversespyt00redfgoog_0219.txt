196 The Golden Verses ol Pythagoras

only as odious vioes that should be avoided! He had no
scruples about drinking a little wine himself, and of tasting
the meets set before him at table? in order to show that
he did not regard them as impure, notwithstanding he pre·
ferred the vegetable regim to all others and that, lor the

One must choose in all things a meon just ond good.

Lysis terminares the purgative part ol the doctrine ol
Pythagoras with the trait which characterizes it in general
and in particular; he has shown the golden mean in virtue
and in science; he has commended itin conduct, he states
in lull and says openly that extremes meet: that luxury
and avarice differ not in their eflects, and that philosophy

consists in avoiding excess in everything. Hierocles adds
that, to be happy, one must know how, where, when, and how
much to take; and that he who is ignorant of these just
limits is always unhappy and he proves it as follows:

Voluptuousness [he said] is necessarily the effect of an action:
now, il the action is good the voluptuousness remains; if itis
evil the voluptuousness passes and is corrupted. When one does
a shameful thing withpleasure‚ the pleasure passes and the shame
remains. When one does an excellent thing with great trouble
and labour the pain passes and the excellence alone remains.
Whence it follows necessarily, that the evil life is also bitter and
produces as much sorrow and chagrin as the good lile is sweet
and procures joy and contentment.⁴
