Examinations of the Golden Verses 199

only the development oi it and that an inscription in the
temple of Greece, that oi Delphi, commended it, after that

which reposed virtue and wisdom which is its consequence.
Nothing further was necessary to electrify the soul of Hera·

knowledge without which all other is but doubt and pre·

in order to distinguish himself from the sophists of his day
who pretended to know everything; as Plato had constantly
used in his teachings that sort of dialectic which, proceeding
toward truth by doubt, consists in defining things for what
they are, knowing their essence, distinguishing those which
are real from those which are only illusory; and above all
as the favourite maxim of these two philosophers had been
that it was necessary to renounce all manner of prejudices,
not pretending to know that of which one is ignorant, and
giving assent only to clear and evident truths; it came to
