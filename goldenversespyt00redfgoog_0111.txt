88 The Golden Verses ol Pythagoras

§vn

Iam beginning with the creator ol epopoeia, with Homer.
It is easy to see by the manner in which this divine man
blends, from the opening lines of the I h‘od, the exposition and
invocation, that, full ol acelestial inspiration that he was
the first to receive, he seeks to pour forth the superabun-
dant fire which consumes him, and to throw into the soul
oi his hearer the impassioned enthusiasm which masters
and controls his own. The following lines will suffice
to make known the subject ol a work which fills twenty—

four cantos.

Deesset viens chanter la colere d’Achille,
Fatale, et pour les Grecs si fertile en malheurs,
Qui, d’avance, aux enters, precipitant en loule
Les emes des heros, livra leurs corps sanglants
Aux dogues affames: ainsi Jupiter meme
Le voulut, quand la haine eut divise les coeurs
Du roi des rois Atride et du divin Achille.
Lequel des Immortels provoqua ce courroux?
Apollon irrite, qui, pour punir Atride,
Ravagea son armee: et les peuples mourraient!

Ο Goddess! sing the wrath of Peleus’ son,
Achilles; sing the deadly wrath that brought
Woes numberless upon the Greeks, and swept
To Hades many a valiant soul, and gave
Their limbs a prey to dogs and birds oi air,—
For so had Jove appointed-from the time
When the two chiels‚ Atrides, King ol men,
And great Achilles, parted first as loes.

Which ol the gods put striie between the chieis,
That they should thus contendi Latona's son
And Jove’s. Incensed against the king, he bade
A deadly pestilence appear among

The army, and the men were perishing. mm
