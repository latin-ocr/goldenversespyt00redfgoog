188 The Golden Verses of Pythagoras

which the power of the Will might exercise itseli trosly, in
such a manner that, although the matter might be deter-
mined beforehand, its torm was not, and that such an immi·

this idea, as simple as profound; and Plato has consecrated
several of his dialogues to its development.d

But the distinction between what one does not know
and the desire to learn that of which one is ignorant, is
a thing much rarer than one imagines. It is the golden
mean of science, as difficult to possess as that of virtue, and
without which it is, however, impossible to know oneseli.
For, without knowledge of oneself, how can one acquire
knowledge of others? How judge themis one cannot be
one's own judge? Pursue this reasoning. It is evident
