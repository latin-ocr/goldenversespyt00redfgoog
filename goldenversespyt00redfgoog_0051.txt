28 The Golden Verses of Pythagoras

fire oi passions, whose movement and fleeting splendour
entrance the vulgar. Vying with each other they had
brought forth a mass oi theological systems, had multiplied
the allegorical lables concerning the universe, and had
drowned, as it were, the unity of the Divinity in the vain
and minute distinction of its infinite iaculties; and as each
composed in his own dialect and in pursuance of his own
caprice, each devised unceasingly new names ior the same
beings, according as they believed they caught a glimpse oi
a certain new virtue in these beings that another had not
expressed, it came to pass that not only were the gods mul-
· tiplied by the distinction oi their facultics, but still more by
3 the diversity of names employed in expressing them. Very
soon there was not a city nor a town in Graece, that did not
² have, or at least believed that it had, its own particular
god. Il one had careiully examined this prodigious num·
ber of divinities, one would have clearly seen that they
could be reduced, by elimination, to a small number and
wordd finally end by being mingled in a sole Universal
Being; but that was very difficolt for people, flattered, more·
over, by a system which compared the condition oi the gods
with theirs, and offered them thus, protectors and patrous
so much the more accessible as they were less occupied
and less powerlul.¹ Vainly, therefore, the Egyptian colony
established at Athens presented to the adoration oi this
, people imbued with the prejudioe oi polytheism, the seve
reign oi the gods under the title ol the Most-High²; the
veneration of this people was turned wholly towards Mi·
nerva, who became its patron under the name oi Athena,³
as Juno was that oi Argos,⁴ Ceres, that oi Eleusis, Phigalia,
Methydrium,⁵ etc.

Orpheus, instructed as was Moses, in the sanctuan'es of
Egypt, had the same ideas as the legislator oi the Hebrews
