92 The Golden Verses of Pythagoras

Ἄνδρα μοι ύννοτι, μοῦσα, πολύτροπον, θς μάλα πολλὰ ·
πλάγχθη, lael Τροίης ίερθν πτολίεθρον ύτερστν,

πολλῶν δ’ύνθρύτων ἴδεν θστεα καί νόον lyve·

ἀρνύμενος ἤν τε ψυχὴν καί νόστον ἑταίρων.

Homer had been created the poetic incentive of Europe,
even as I have said, and judging on the other hand that
An'osto had made an epic poem, are convinced that the
Italian poet had copied the Greek;‘;but this is not so. Ari·
osto, who has made only a romanesque poem, has not re·

is as essential to it as it is harmful to veritable cpopocia; this
is why the eumolpique verses never conform to it in the
slightest degree. To apply them to it, is to make serious
what is by nature gay, it is to give a character of force and
of truth to what is only light, airy, and fantastic. I am
