232 The Golden Verses os Pythagoras

there is no movement. Be assured of this. Without the
operation oi the will, the soul is inert and the spirit sterile.
This is the origin of that inequality among men ol which
1 have spoken. When the will does not disengage itself
from matter, it constitutes instinctive men; when it is oon-
centrated in the understanding, it produces animistic men:
when it acts in the spirit, it creates intellectual men. Its
perfect harmony in the primordia] Ternary, and its aetion
more or less energetie in the unifomrity ol their faculties,
equally developed, constitute the extraordinary men en-
dowed with sublime genius; but the men oi this fourth class
which represents the autopsy ol the mysteries,⁰ are ex-
tremelyrare. Often it sufficesforapowerful will, acting either
in the understanding or in the intelligence and concentrating
wholly there, to astonish men by the strength of reasoning
and outbursts of wisdom, which draws the name of genius
without being wholly merited. Recently there has been
seen in Germany the most extraordinary reasoning, in
Kant, failing in its aim through lack of intelligence; one has
seen in the same country the most exalted intelligence, in
. Boehme, giving way forwant of reason. There have been in
¹ all times and among all nations men similar to Boehme and
tto Kant. These men have erred through not knowing
themselves; they have erred, through a lael< of harmony
that they might have been able to acquire, if they had
taken the time to perfect themselves; they have arrad, but
their very error attests the force of their will. A weak will,
operating either in the understanding or in the intelligence,
makes only sensible men and men of intellect. This same
will acting in the instinct produces artful men; and ii it is
strong and violently concentrated through its original at-
traction in this corporal faculty, it constitutes men danger-
ous to society, misereants, and treacherous brigands.
