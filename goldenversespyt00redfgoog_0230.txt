Examinations ol the Golden Verses > 207

make an explanation ol this science; lor this labour‚ out of
place in these Examinations, would carry me too lar. My
intention is only to show the point wherein it has given way,
and how it has furnished new weapons for the skeptios,
in not holding well to the promise that it had made ol deter-
mining the principle of knowledge. Therelore, I will sup·
pose the doctrine ol Kant understood or partially so. Several
works, circulated somewhat extensively in France, have
unravelled it sufficiently to the savants.⁰¹ Iwill only say
what the authors of these works have been unable to say,
and this will be the general result of the impression that the
study ol this doctrine has made upon me: it is that Kant,
who pretends to found all his doctrine upon principles,

purely intelligible, conceming the principle oi knowledge,
has done precisely the opposite from what he wished to do;
for not finding what he sought, he has lound what he has
not sought, that is to say, the essenoe of matter. Let the
disciples of this philosophy give attention to what 1 say.

better or to depict it better. 'He uses neither figures, nor
symbols; he tells what he sees with a candour which would

may say, bave analysed very well the logical part ol Kantism, and have
penetrated, especially the lonuer, into the rational part, as lar as it was pos-
sible, ior men who write upon the system oi a philosopher without adopting
tbe principles and making themselves his followers.
