242 The Golden Verses of Pythagoras

clearly in speaking of the virtue attached to certain names
invoked by the Egyptian sagea and the most enlightened
of the magians of Persia· Synesius, the famous Bishop
of Ptolemais, initiated into the mysteriis, declares that the
scienoe, by means of which one linked the intelligible ee
seneen to sentient forms, by the invocation of spirits, was
neither vain nor criminal, but on the contrary quite inno
oent and founded upon the nature of things! Pythagoras
was aocused of magic. Ignorance and weaknens of mind
have always charged scienne with this banal accusation‘
This philosopher, rightly placed in the rank of the ablest
physicians of Greeoe,‘ was according to his most devoted
disciples, neither of the number of the gods, nor even of
those of the divine heroes; he was a man whom virtue and
wisdom had adorned with a likeness to the gods, hythe
complete purifying of his understanding which had been
effected through contemplation and prayer.‘ 'l’his is what
Lysis expressed by the following lines:

27. Instrucfed hy them, noughl shall then deceive thee,-
0] diuma beings thou shall round tlte essence;
And thou sholt know the principle and end os All.

That is to say, that the true disciple of Pythagoraa,
placed en rapport with the gods through contemplation,
arrived at the highest degree of perfection, called in the
mysteries autopsy; saw fall before him the false veil which
until then had hidden Truth‚ and contemplated Nature in
its remotest sources Itis necessary, in order to attain to
this sublime degree, that the intelligence, penetrated hy
the divine ray of inspirati0n‚ should fill the understanding
