70 The Golden Verses ol Pythagoras

England and Germany were inundated witha mass of ro-
mances and ballads‚ wherein were pictured the knights ol the
court of Charlemagne and those of the Round Table.¹ All
these works were written in verse, and the greater part,
particularly those composed by the troubadours or their

the allegorical sense of their model, had only developed and
enriched it with their own knowledge; the others, following

author ol the hieroglyphic figures which adom the portal ol Notre-Dame‚ and

³Perhaps one is astonished to see that 1 give the name ol sinales, or
sylves, to that which is commonly called the poenis ol Dante: but in order to
