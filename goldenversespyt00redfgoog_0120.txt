The Essence and Form os Poetry 97

O Musa, tu, che di caduchi allori
Non circondi la fronte in Elicona
Ma su nel Ciel infra i beati cori,
Hai di stelle immortali aurea corona,
Tu spira al petto mio celesti ardori,
Tu rischiara il mio canto, e tu perdona,
S’intesso fregi al ver, s'adorno in parte
D’altri diletti, che de' tuoi, le carte.

The captivating enthusiasm ol Homer, the majestic
simplicity ol Vergil are not there; there is a sweetness of
expression, a purity of imagery which please. This might
be greater, hut· then the melancholy ol the romanoe would
exclude it and the reader would demand the full force oi
epopoeia.

Besides, the Italians have tried, over and over again, to
vary the form of their verses; some have wished to measure
them by musical rhythm others have contented themselves
with making blank verse. They have neither succeeded
completely nor failed completely. Their language sweet
and musical lacks force whether in good or in evil. Its
words might indeed, strictly speaking, be composed of long
and short syllables; but as they terminate, nearly all, in
the soit and languid style that we call feminine, it results,
therefore, that in the measured verses the poets laclr the
long syllables to constitute the last ioot and to form the
spondee, and that in the blank verse they are obliged to
terminate thern all in the same style: so that with the meas·
ure they create only lame verses, and without the rhyme
they make them all equally languid.¹

¹ Nearly all ol the Italian words terminate with one oi four vowels, o, e, i, o,
without secent: it is very rare that the vowels are acoentuated, as the vowel
ri. When this occurs as in cdd, perche, dl, jort), eto, then, only, is the final
masculine. Now here is what one of their best rhythmic poets, named Tolo-
mbo, gives as an hexameter verse:

Quaesu, per effeto, merissima leuem mondo
Ate . . .

To maire this line exact, one leels that the word mondo, which tenninaus it,
should be composed oi two longs, thet is to say, that it should be written
