214 The Golden Verses of Pythagoras

seatisinthesoul,withoneoihisseoondaryfaculties,his
reason, finds himself, in raising this reason outside oi its
place and giving it a dominance that it has not, ousting
entirely the spiritual part; so that meditating constantly
inthemedienpartofhisbeing,whichhebelievedtobethe
superior, and descending, he found matter, understood it
perlectly, and missed absolutely the spirit. What he as-
sumed was, it was nothing else than the understanding, a
neuter faculty placed between sense perception which is
purely passive, and the intelligence which is wholly active.
· He had the wealmess to fix his thought here and thenoeforth
was lost. Reason which he invoked to teach him to distin·
guish, in his ideas, the part which is furnished by the spirit,
from that which is given by objecta was only able to show
him the straight line that it described in his understanding.
This line being buried in matter instead of rising in intel·
ligible regions, taught him that everything that did not
correspond to a possible experience oould not lurnish him
the subject ol a positive knowledge, and thus all the great
questions upon the existence oi God, the immortality of the
soul, the origin of the Universe; all that pertains to theoso
phy, to cosmology; in short, all that which is intelligible, can-
not take place in the order of his understanding.⁶ This
catastrophe, quite inevitable as it was, was none the less
poignant. It was odd to see a man who seemed to promise
to establish the possibility and the principles of all know-
ledge upon an incontestable basis, announce coldly that
God, the Universe, and the Soul could not be subjects there,
and soon discover, pushed by the force ol his reasoning,
that even the reality of physical subjects by which tif
senses are affected is only phenomenal, that one can in no
way know what they are, but only what they appear to

inter eligere or elicere, to choose, to attract to seli interiorly, and by sympathy.
The etymology oi the word expresses exactly the use ol the faculty.
