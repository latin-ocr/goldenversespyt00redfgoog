Examinations of the Golden Verses 239

os the septuagiens, shed no light upon this important point;
but it is well to know that these interpretem have designedly
concealed this light, in order not to divulge the meaning of
their sacred book. If one understood thoroughly the lan·
guage of Moses, one would see that, far from setting aside
the theosophical traditions which he had received in Egypt,
this theocratic legislator remained constantly faithful to
them. The passage in his Sepher where he speaks of the
annihilationof Evil, in the meaning of Zoroaster, is in chapter
iii, v. 15, of the part vulgarly called Genesis, as I hope one
day to show.⁰ But without entering at this time, into
the discussion where the real translation of this passage
would lead me, let it suffice to say that the early Christians
were very far from admitting the etemity of evil; for with·
out spealdng of Manes and his numerous followers who
shared the opinion of Zoroaster? those who are versed
in these sorts of matters know that Origen taught that
tormenta will not be eternal, and that demens, instructed
by chastisement‚ will be converted at last and will obtain
their pardon‘ He was followed in this by a great number
of leamed men, by the evidence of Beausobre who quotes,
on this subject, the example of a philosopher of Edessa,
who maintained that after the consummation of the ages, all
creaturos would become consubstantial with uod!

One thing worthy of notice is that Zoroaster, who bas
made prayer one of the principal dogmas of his religion, has
been imitated in this by Mohammed, who, unknowingly,
perhaps, has borrowed a great number of things from this
ancient legislator of the Parsees. Itis presumable that the

⁰ lt is necessary before alltc restore the language of Moses, lost, aa I
have said, for more than twenty-four centuries; it must be restored with the
aid of Greek and latin which chain it to the illusory versions; it is necessary
to go back to its original source and find its true roots: tlns mormcus work
that I have undertaken, l have accomplished.
