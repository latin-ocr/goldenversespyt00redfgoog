Examinations ol the Golden Verses 147

Universe, under the name of Destiny or Fatality, they had
seen it balanced by the Power ol the Will, and subject to the
Providential Cause whence all emanates. The disciples
of Plato would also have evaded many errors, if they had
clearly understood this concatenation of the two oppoeed
principles, from which results universal equilibrium; but
following certain false interpretatione of the doctrine oi
their master regarding the soul of matter, they had imagined
that this soul was no other than Necessity by which it is
ruled⁰; so that, according to them, this soul being in·
herent in matter, and bad in itseli, gave to Evil a necessary
existence: a dogma quite formidable, since it makes the
world to be considered as the theatro of a struggle without
beginning or end, between Providence‚ principle of Good, and
the soul of matter, principle of Evil. The greatest mistake
oi the Platonists, exactly contrary to that of the Stoice,
was in having confused the free power oi the wil] with the
divine Providence‚ in having instituted it for the principle
oi good and thus being put in position of maintaining that
there are two souls in the world, a beneficent one, God, and
a malefic one, Matter. This system, approved ol by many
celebrated men oi antiquity and which Beausobre assuras
was the most widely received! offers as I have observed,
the very great disadvantage ol giving to Evil a necessary
existence, that is to say, an independent and eternal exist·
ence. Now, Bayle has very well proved, by attacking this
system through that of Manes, that two opposed Principles
cannot exist equally eternal and independent of one another,
because the clearest ideas of order teach us that a Being
which exists by itseli, which is necessary, which is eternal,
must be unique, infinite, all-poweriul, and endowed with all
manner of perfections.⁶

But it is not at all certain that Plato may have had the
