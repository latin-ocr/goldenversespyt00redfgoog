136 The Golden Verses of Pythagoras

of lights; it was believed that this creative Unity, inacces-
sible to the understanding even, produced by emanation
a diffusion of light which, proceeding from the centre to
the circumference, losing insensibly its splendour and its
purity in proportion as it receded from its source, ended by
being absorbed in the confines of darkness; so that its diver-

repulsed by the darkness, were condensed in commingling
with it, and, taking a material shape, formed all the kinds of
beings that the world contains. Thus was admitted, be·
tween the Supreme Being and man, an incalculable chain
of intermediary beings whose perfectioris decreased propor-
tionably with their 3113331133 11331 1113 Creative Principle.
All the philosophers and all the sectarians who admired
this spiritual hierarchy considered, under the relations
peculiar to them, the different beings of which it was com·

and later made use of these same names to evoke them:
from this came the Persian magic, which the Jews, having
received by tradition during their captivity in Babylon,
called Kobbolo.⁰ This magic became mixed with astro·
logy among the Chaldeans, who regarded the 31313 33 ani-
mated beings belonging to the universal chain 31 divine
emanations; in Egypt, it became linked with the mysteries
31 Nature, and was enclosed in the sanctuaries, where it
was taught by the priests under the safeguard 31 symbols
and hieroglyphics. Pythagoras, 13 conceiving this spiritual
hierarchy as a geometrica] progression, considered the beings
which compose it under harmonious relations, and based,
by analogy, the laws of the universe upon those of music.
He called the movement of the celestial spheres, harmony,
and made use of numbers to express the faculties 31 different
beings, their relations and their influences. Hierocles men·

⁰The word bap signifies, in Hebrew, Arabio, and Chaldean, that which
is anterior, that which one receives from the ancients by tradition.
