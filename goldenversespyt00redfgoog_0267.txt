244 The Golden Verses os Pythagoras

toward which they aspire,·and in which they are finally ab·
sorbed. this'Spiritisthat,tothe knowledge oi which thou shouldst
aspire, the Great Being.⁰-The Universe is one oi its forms.⁶
—It is the Being oi beings: without form, without quality, with·

. Truth and the Science which never perish.⁴-lts wisdom, its

power, and its plan, are es an immense and limitless sea which no
being is in condition either to traverse or to iathom. There
is no other God than it. The Universe is filled with its im·
mensity. lt is the principle oi all things without having princi-
ples! God is one! eternal, like unto a perfect sphere which has
neither beginning nor end. He rules and governs all that ex·
ists by a general providence, resultant oi fixed and determined
principles. Man ought not to seek to penetrate the nature or
the essence oi this Ineffable Being: such a research isvain and

Thns do the Hindu sages express themselves in sundry
plaoes. They commend aspiring to the knowledge oi the
Being of beingS, making oneself worthy to be absorbed in
its bosom; and forbid, at the same time, secking to penetrate

attain to the highest degree oi human perlection, and who,
by the purification of his understanding, and the acquisition
oi celestial virtues puts himself in a state to receive the
truth, must observe that the higher he rises in the intelligible
sphere, the nearer he approaches to the nnfathomable Being
