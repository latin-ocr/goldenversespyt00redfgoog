236 The Golden Verses of Pythagoras

therefore that which is not, can never produce that which is.
That which is, is; therefore, that which is not, is not that
which is. Everything has its opposite and can have only
one; therefore the absolute opposite ol that which is, is
that which is not. If the skeptie refuses himself the evid-
ence of common sense, of reason and of sagacity united, he
lies to his conscience, or he is mad and then one must leave

The difference admitted between that which is and that
which is not, proceeds therefore against Bayle, or against
those who resemble him; ask themis man is a prey to abso-
lute evil, whether physical or moral? They will reply to
you, no, for they will feel that if they should respond other-
wise, you would prove to them that not having the faculty
of making a difference between good and evil, nor of com-
paring them together, they could never draw from this
comparison their strongest argument against Provideuce.
They will, therefore, reply that man is not a prey to absolute
evil, but to a very great relative evil, as great as they wish.
You, nevertheless continue thus: if man is not a prey to
absolute evil, he might be, since it would suffice for this to
take away the sum of good which mitigates the evil, and
which the difference, previously established between that
which is and that which is not, teaches to distinguish. Now
this sum of good, whence comes it? Who dispenses it?
Who? If the skeptics are silent, affirm for them that it
emanates from the gods themselves and that Providence
is the dispenset. Then reply to their dilemma, and say
that the gods are content with their administration and
that they have reason to be, since by it they procure a
sum of good increasing more and more, for the beings which
without Providence would never know it; and that their
Providence, which has mitigated evil from its origin, miti-
gates it still and will mitigate it to its end; and if the aston-
ished skeptics object that Providence takes a great deal of
timeto make what should be made in an instant, reply to
