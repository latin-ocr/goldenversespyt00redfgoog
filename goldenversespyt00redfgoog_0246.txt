see that the dogma of inequality among men had served as
basis for the civil and religious laws of all the peoples of the
earth, from the orient of Asia to the occidental limits of
Africa and Europe. Everywhere, four great established
divisions under the name of Castes recalled the four prin-
cipal degrees of initiation and retraoed upon humanity
en morse, the Universal Quatemary. Egypt had, in this
respect, in very ancient times, given example to Greece⁰;
for this Greece, so proud of her liberty, or rather of her tur·
bulent anarchy, had been at first subjected to the common
division, even as it is seen in Aristotle and strabo? The
Chaldeans were, relative to the peoples of Assyria,⁶ only
what the Magi were among the Persians,⁴ the Dmids
among the Gauls‘ and the Brahmans among the¹ Indians.
It is quite well known that this last people, the Brahmans,
constitute the foremost and highest of the four castes of
which the whole nation is composed. The allegorical origin
that religion gives to these castes proves clearly the analogy
of which I‘have spoken. Τὴθ following is what is found
relative to this in one of the Shastras. “At the first crea-
tion by Brahma, the Brahmans sprang from his mouth;
the Kshatrys issued from his arms; the Vaisyas from his
thighs, and the Soudras from his feet.” Itis said in another
of these books containing the cosmogony of the BanianS,
that the first man, called Pourou, having had four sons
named Brahma, Kshetri, Vaisa, and Souderi‚ God designated
them to be chiefs of the four tribes which he himself insti·
tuted! The sacred books of the Burmans, which appear
