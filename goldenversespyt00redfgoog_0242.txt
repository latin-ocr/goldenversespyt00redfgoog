three great modifications which form the human Quaternary
manifest themselves by sensation, sentiment, and assent,
and develop the principal faculties of the instinct, the un· .

many brilliant paradoxas that modern philosophers, *more

draws me on and sinoe Ι am explaining the doctrine of
Pythagoras, it is indeed necessary that Ι should say why
Lysis, alter having examined and commended in detail all
the human virtues in the purgative part ol his tecchings,
begins again a new instruction in the unitive part and pro·
mises to lead one to divine virtues. This important'distinc·
