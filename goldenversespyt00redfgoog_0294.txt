’ decision of these pretended savants, and who does not put
perlectibility in the rank oi the most rigorously demonstrated
truths.

authority would be challenged; I shall even limit myself, to
evade prolixities, to a small number oi striking passages
among the moderns. Leibnitz, who ought less than any
other to admit perfectibility, since he had founded his system

organize bodies as much as is possible.⁶ The school of
Kant has pushed the system oi perfectibility as iar as it
