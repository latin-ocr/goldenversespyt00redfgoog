was, in its turn, considered under three modifications, eo
that the temary ruling in the whole nrled equally in the

Pythagoras was not, however, the inventor of this doctrine:
it was spread from China to the depths of Scandinavia'

faculty, courage for the irascible faculty, prudence lor the
rational faculty, and for these three faculties together,
