going lines, because the morale which they contain, founded
upon the procis of sentiment, are not susceptible of receiving
others. I do not know ii this simple reflecticn has already
been made, but in any case it ought to draw with it one more
complicated, and serve to find the reason for the surprising

and the sanctity of their morals; but ii it must be told them
