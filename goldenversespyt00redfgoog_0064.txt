The Essence and Form of Poetry 41

happy blending of long and short syllables, had long since
shaken off the servile yoke of rhyme. Now, by rhythm
was understood the number and respective duration ol the
time ol which a verse was composed.¹ A long syllable was
equal to a time divided in two instante, and equivalent to
two short syllables. A foot was what we name today a
measure. The foot contained two times, made up of two
long, or oi one long and two short syllables. The verse
most commonly used was the hexameter, that is, that in
which the extent was measured by six rhythmis feet and
oi which the whole duration was twelve times. Thus poetry
reoeived only the laws of rhythm it was a kind ol music
whose particular barmony, free in its course, was subject
only to measure.

Greekshad ever used the rhyme in their verse. Itis stated,
however, that they have not differed from other nations
in this respect. Voltaire said so but without proof.² What
is most certain is that, taking the word epos,l a verse, in
its most restricted acceptance, expressing atum, a turning

before him. His genius, incapable of enduring chains, would
have refused to clothe itself in a form capable of stifling it.
But this celebrated man would no doubt have changed it;
