of spirit· Zeno of Elea particularly, who denied the
existence of movement, brought against this existence some
objections very difficult to remove! The Stoic philo

taught that God is the soul of the world, and the world,
the universal extension of that soul. He said that by
Jupiter, should be understood, the eterna] law, the fatal
necessity, the immutable truth of all future things.‘

was directed toward them, of admitting the most absolute
fatality, since the soul of man being, according to them, only
