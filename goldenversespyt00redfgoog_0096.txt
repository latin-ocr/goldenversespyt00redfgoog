The Essence and Fonn of Poetry 73

the highest perfection that they were able to attain. The
century of louis XIV, so fertile in able versifiers, in pro-
found rhymers, saw, however, the dawn of Epic poems only
as a signal of their failure. Chapelain had, nevertheless,
shown talent before his catastrophe; wishing to interest
the French nation, he had chosen in its history the sole epic
subject which he found there. Why had he not succeeded?
This point was considered, and the truth still lacking, they
went on to imagine that the fault was inherent in the French
tongue, and that it was no longer capable of rising to the
heights of Epopoeia: deplorable error, which for a long time
has been harmful to the development of a tongue destined
to become universal and to carry to future centuries the
discoveries of past ones.

Ronsard had felt the difficulty most. Accustomcd as
he was to read Greek and Latin works in the original, he
had seen clearly that what prevented the French tongue from
following their poetic movement was particularly the re·
strnint of the rhyme; he had even sought to free it from this
servitude, endeavouring to make the French verses scan
according to the ancient rhythm; but, in another way he
had not appreciated the genius of that tongue which refused
to follow this rhythm. Jodelle, Ball, Passerat, Desportes,
flenti-Etienne, and certain other savants, have made at
different times the same attempt, and always without re-
sults.¹ Each tongue has its own character which it is
necessary to know; ours has not at all the musical prosody
of the Greek and Latin; its syllables are not determined,
long and short, by the simple duration of time, but by the
different accentuation and inflection of the voice. Among
our writers the one who has best understood the nature of
this prosody is certainly the abbe d'Olivet: he declared firstly
that he did not believe it possible to make French verses
