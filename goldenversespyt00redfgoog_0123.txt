roo The Golden Verses of Pythagoras

as that oi the mysten'es of Orpheus; if he had made use of
a language so harmonicus, if his taste had been able to bc

refined at the school ol Pindar or of Homer. At the epoch
oi his birth, Europe scarcely emerged from the gloom of

barbarism; the theatro, given over to ridiculous mounte-
banks, profaned in inderent farces the incomprehensible
mysteries oi the Christian religion, and the English tongue,
still crudeand unformed, had not succeededinamalgamating
in one single body the opposed dialects of which it was
successively formed. In spite of these obstacles, Shake
speare stamped upon England a movement of which Europe
felt the influence. Raised by the sole force of his genius to
the essence of dramatic poetry, he dared to scel< lor his
subjects in the mythology of Odin, and put upon the stage,
in Homlet and in Mocheth, tableaux of the highest character.¹

¹ There remains to us oi this poetry the very precious fragments contained
in the Eddo and in Voluspo. The Eddo, whose name signifies greatgrand·
mother, is a collection, fairly ample, oi Scandinwian traditione. Volurpo is
a sort ol Sibylline book, or cosmogonic oracle, as its name indicates. 1 am
convinced tint ii the poets of the north, the Danes, Swedes, and Germans,
had oltener drawn their subjeets from these indigenous sources, they would
have sumeded better than by going to Greece to seek them upon the summits
oi Parnassus. The mythology of Odin, descended from the Rhipaeun moun·
tains, suits them better than thet of the Greeks, whose tongue furthermore is
not conformable here. When one makes the moon and the wife (der Mond,
dos Weit) of masculine and neuter gender; when one makes the sun, the air,
time, love (die Sonne, die Luft, die Zeis, die Licha) ol feminine gender, one
ought wisely to renounce the allegories ol Parnassus. It was on account ol
the sex given to the sun and the moon that the schism arose, oi which I have
’ spoken, in explaining the origin ol the temple ol Delphi.

The Scandinaviau allegories, however, that I considera debris oi Thracian
allegories, furnishing subjects ol a very different character lrom those ol the
Greeks and latins, might have varied the poetry oi Europe and prevented
the Arabesque fiction from holding there so much ascendancy. The Scan·
dinavian verses, being without rhyme, hold moreover, to eumolpoeia. The
following is a strophe from Voluspo:

“Avant que le temps fut, Ymir avait et&
Ni la mer, ni nes vente n'existaient pas encore,
Il n'etait de terre, il n'etait point de ciel:
Tout n'etait qu'ua abtme immense, sans verdure.”
