66 The Golden Verses ol Pythagoras

But without in any way anticipating time, without even
leaving our subject which is poetry, let us continue to follow
the developments oi this science.

The original poets ol Graece and Rome, brought into
Italy by the savants whom the taking of Constantinople
forced to go back towards the Occident of Europe, brought
there an unexpected brilliancy, which, with the ancient
germs deeply bun'ed in its midst, soon awakened certain
new germs that the peculiar circumstances had also brought
there. In explaining what these germs were, I am giving
occasion for thinkers to make certain reflections, and critics
to form certain singular conjectures upon works hitherto
badly judged.

It is necessary at first, that Ι repeat a truth which I
have already said: that intellectual nature is always one
and the same, whereas physica] nature varies, changes
unceasingly with time and place, and is modified in a
thousand ways according to circumstances. Now, it is

its aptitude more or less great, in receiving and in
working upon the intelligence, can make the things which
are more homogeneous in their principle appear more

the most profound obscurity covered Europe, whilst
ignorance spread on all sides its baleful veils, there were

sorcerer, and conducted them to tortura as the price of their
