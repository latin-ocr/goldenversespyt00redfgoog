¹7⁰ The Golden Verses of Pythagoras

dominion of Providence between the past and the future,
endowed with a free will by his essenos, and being carried
along toward virtue or vice with its own movement, Man,
Ι say, should understand the source of the evils that he
necessarily experiences; and far from accusing this same
Providence which dispenses good and evil to each according
to his merit and his anterior actions, can blame only himself
if he suffers, through an inevitable consequence of his past
mistakes.· For Pythagoras admitted many successive exis·
tenoes,⁵arrdmaintained that the present, which strikes us, and
the future, which menaces us, are only the expression of the
past which has been our work in anterior times. He said that
the greater part of men lose, in retuming to life, the remem-
brance of these past existences; but that, concaming himself,
he had, by a particular favour of the gods, preserved the
memory of them.‘ Thus according to his doctrine, this
fatal Necessity‚ of which man unceasingly complains, has
been created by himself through the use of his will; he
traverses, in proportion as he advances in time, the road that
he has already traced for himself: and according as he has
modified it by good or evil, as he sows so to speak, his virtues
or his viceS, he will find it again more smooth or laborinuS,
when the time will come to traverse it anew.

These are the dogmas by means of which Pythagoras
established the necessity of Destiny, without harming the
power of the Will, and left to Providence its universal empire,
without being obliged either to attribute to it the origin
of evil, as those who admitted only one principle of things,
or to give to evil an absolute existence, as those who ad·
mitted two principles. In this, he was in accordance with
the ancient doctrine which was followed by the oracles of
the godsd The Pythagoreans, however, did not regard
