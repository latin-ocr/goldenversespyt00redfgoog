140 The Golden Verses os Pythagoras

It is worthy of observaticn, that Pythagoras begins the
purgative part of his doctrine by commending the observ·
ance of natural duties‚ and that he places¹ in the rank of
‘primary virtues, filial piety, paternal and conjugal love.
Thus this admirable philosopher made it his first care to
strengthen the ties oi blood and make them cherished and
·sacred; he exhorts respect to children, tenderness tc parents,
and union tc all the members of the family; he follows thus
the profound sentiment which Nature inspires in all sen·
tient beings, very different in this from certain legislators‚
blinded by false politius, wh0‚ in order to conduct men to
I know not what power and what imaginary welfare, have
‘ wished, on the contrary, to break those ties, annihilato those
relationships of father, son, and brother, to concentrate,
they said, upon a being oi reason called Country the al·
fection that the soul divides among those objects cf its
first love.⁰ Ii the legislators had cared to reflect a
moment, they would have seen that there existed no country
lor the one who had no father, and that the respect andlcve
that a man in his virile age feels for the place cf his birth,
holds its principle and receives its force from those same
sentiments that he felt in his iniancy for his mother. Every
effect proclaims a,cause; every edifice rests upon a founda-
tion: the real cause of love of country is maternal love; the
sole foundations of the social edifice are paternal power and
filial respect. From this sole power issues that of the prince,
who, in every well-organized state, being considered as
father of the people, has right to the obedience and respect
of his children.

I am going to make here a singular comparison which l

⁰ Not long since, a man rather well organized mentally, but very slightly
enlightened by the true sdence, brought out a book entitled Rweroblrowi, in
which, heaping up all the ancient and modern sophisms pnonounced against
the sccial organizaticn founded upon the establishment of the family, he
aspired to change the instinct oi nature, in this respect, and tc found true
happiness upon the dibris ct all the ties ol blood, ol all the allections oi the
soul, and ciali the duties ci consanguinity.
