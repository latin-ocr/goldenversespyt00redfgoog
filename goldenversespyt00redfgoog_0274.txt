Atia in mylling, is the sonte in every ploce.

I have already said that the homogeneity of Nature was,
with the unity of God, one of the greatest secreta of the
mysteries. Pythagoras founded this homogeneity upon the
unity of the spirit by which it is penetrated and from which,
according tc him, all our souis draw their ofigin! This
dogma which he had received from the Chaldeans and from
the priests of Egypt was admitted by all the seges of an-
tiquity, as is proved at great length by Stanley and the
astute Beausobre.‘ These sages established a harmony, a
perfect analogy between heaven and earth, the intelligiblc
and the sentient, the indivisible substance and the divisible
substanoe; in such a manner that that which took place in one
of the regions of the Universe or of the modifications of the
primordial Temary was the exact image of that which took
place in the other. This idea is found very forcibly revealed
by the ancient Thoth, called Hermes Trisnoegisrusf by the
Greeks, in the table of Emerald which is attributed tc him.

In truth, and without fiction, in truth, in truth, Ι say to
you, that things inferior are like untc the superior, both unite
their invincible forces to produce one sole thing, the most mar·
vellous of all, and as all things are emanated by the will cf one
unique God, thus all things whatscever must be engendered by
this sole thing—by a disposition of Universal nature!
