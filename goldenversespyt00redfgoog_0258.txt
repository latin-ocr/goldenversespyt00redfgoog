Examinations of the Golden Verses 235

even that he must, demand counsel. This is the rational
principle of prayer. Now, common sense is the asking for
counsel wiser than its own, and sagacity shows in the Gods
the source of wisdom.

Epicurus, nevertheless, denied the intervention of divine
Providence and pretended that the Gods, absorbed in their
supreme felicity, do not mingle in any affairs A single
question, simple and naive, would overthrow this assertion
destitute os proosS, and besides, inconsistent with the conduct
os Greek philosophy; but I prefer to leave this question to
Bayle, who has expended much logic in sustaining this point.
This French philosopher, under pretext of making Epicurus
dispute with a polytheistic priest, advances against Provi-
dence an argument which he believes irresistible, and which
is, indeed, one of the most subtle that one could possibly ad·
vanoe. “Are the gods satisfied with their administration or
arc they dissatisfied? Be mindful,'' he says, “of my dilemma:
if they are satisfied with what comes to pass under their
providence, they are pleased with evil;if they aredissatisfied,
they are unhappy.”⁶ The manner in which Bayle throws
himself into the midst of the question, without examining
the principles of it, denounces him as a skeptic; it is neces·
sary therefore to use against him the weapons that 1
have given against skepticism; that is, to bring him back
abruptly to the principles, by interrogating himbefore reply·
ing to him. It is necessary to ask him, if he admits a differ·
ence between that which is and that which is not? He is
forced to admit it, as 1 have said; sor in whatever region
of himself his will takes refuge, whether it exercises its

judgment in the instinct, in the understanding or in the
intelligence, you will pursue it in him opposing, in the first
case, the axiom of common sense: nothing is made from

nothing; in the second, that of reason: that which is, is:
in the last, that of sagacity: everything has its opposite
and can have only one. Nothing is made from nothing
