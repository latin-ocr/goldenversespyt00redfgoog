44 The Golden Verses ol Pythagoras

This inspiration is immediate; it emanates from the first
principle oi all intelligence, in the same manner, to use the
comparison of Plato, that the magnetic force which animates
the loadstone, emanates from its cause. Itis proioundly
hidden from our eyes: it is this which fires the genius oi a
theosophist such as Thoth, Orpheus, and Zomaster; the
genius oi 3 theocrat, such as Krishna, Moses, or Mohammed;
the genius oi 3 philosopher, such as Kong·Tse, Pythagoras,
or socrates, the genius ol 3 poet, such as Homer or Valmiki;
and ol a triumphant hero, such as Cyrus, Alexander, or
Napoleon.

Those who follow in the footprints of these primordia]
men, who allow themselves to be impressed by their genius,
receive what I call the second inspiration. They can still
be great men; ior those who assist them are very great;
they can also communicate the inspiration, for it acts in
them with an exuberant force. Let us oonfine ourselves
to the poetic inspiration and listen to the voice of Plato:

The Muse inspires the poets directly, and these, communicat·
ing to others their enthusiasm, torm a chain oi inspired men. It
is by means oi this chain that the Divinity attracts the souls
oi men, and moves them at his pleasure, causing his virtue to
pass from link to link, from the first inspired poet to the last
oi his readers or his rhapsodists.¹

It is by means of this magnetic chain that one can, in
another sphere ol movement, explain this truth so well
known, that great ldngs make great mem it is also in this
manner that one can understand how a monaroh, called to
iound a vast empire, makes his will penetrate all hearts,
take possession of all souls, and propagating his valour more
and more, electrify his army and fill it with 3 multitude ol
heroes.

Homer received therefore a first inspiration; he was
created to become the poetic motive of Europe, the principle
