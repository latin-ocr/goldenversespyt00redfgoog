the portion of the vulgar. More or less apparent it insinuates
itself in the midst of the other tw0, multiplies the images of
the intellectual modifications and the natural principles, and

invasion, end by stiffing utterly the spirit of it beneath the
material covering which envelops them. This cult, the cradle
of all religions, with which the other two can never entirely
dispense, which nourishes and lives in their life, is also the

will one raise to that which is incomprehensible, inaccessible,
unfathomable? The theosophists and sages have realined
these difficulties; they have seen that it was necessary to
suppress all discourse, to set aside all simulacra: to re·
