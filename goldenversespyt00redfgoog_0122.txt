The Essence and Form ol Poetry 99

also it is in everything the opposite of the Italian. It
is true that it possesses great energy‚ great boldness oi
expression, and a grammatica] liberty which goes to
the full extent; but deprived of sweetness and softness, it
is, if I may say it, like those brittle metals whose strength
is in stiffness, and which is broken when one would make
them flexible. The poverty of its rhymes, denuded for
the most part of accuracy of accent and of harmony in
consonants, has for a long time engaged the English poets
in making blank verse, and it must be admitted that, not-
withstanding the defect inherent in their tongue and which
consists, as I have just said, in the absolute lack of feminine
finals, they have succeeded in this better than any of the
poets of other nations. These lines, all imperfect in their
hannony, are however, as to form, the only eumolpique
verse that they could malre. Shakespeare felt it and made
use oi it in his tragedies.

Shakespeare with the creative genius with which nature
had endowed him, would have borne dramatic art to its
perlection in these modern times, if circumstances had been
as favourable to him as they were adverse. Emulator of
AEschylus, he might have equalled and perhaps surpassed
him, if he had had at his disposal a mine so n'ch, so bn'lliant

fire. Resides it is never taken into account, either in' the measure or in the
prosody ol the lines. Thus these two lines oi Dryden rhyme exectly:

“Now soeroe the Trojan fleet with soils and oars
Had left behind the loir Sicilian shores. . . . ”
AEneid, b. i., v. ⁵⁰·
lt is the same in these ol Addison:

“Tune ev’ry string and ev'ry tongue,
Be thou the Mose end subject ol our song. . . .”
St. Cecilio's Doy, i.. ιο.
or these lrom Goldsmith:

“How often have 1 loiter'd o'er thy green,

Where humble happiness endeared each scene.”
The Desertod Villoge, i, 7.
