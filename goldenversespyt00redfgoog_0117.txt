94 The Golden Verses oi Pythagoras

Le donne, i cavalier, Parme, gl'amori
Le oortesie, l'andaci imprese io canto,
Che turo al tempo che passaro i Mori
D'Airica il mare, e in Francia noequer tanto,
Seguendo l’ire e i giovenil furori
D'Agramante lor re, che si die vanto
Di vendicar la morte di Troiano
Sopra re Carlo imperator romano.

Dird d'Orlando in un medesmo tratto
Cosa non detta in prosa mai, ne in rima;
Che per amor venne in lurore e mette,
D'uom che sl saggio era stimato prima:

Se da colei che tal quasi m’ha tatto
Che'l poeo ingegno ad or ad ormi lima,
Me ne sara perd tanto concesso,

Che mi basti a finir quanto ho promesso.

Itis very easy to see, in reading these two strophas,
that there exists in the exposition no sort of resemblance
either with that ol Homer, or with that oi Vergil. Itis a
third style, wholly foreign to the other two. Homer min-
gling the exposition and the invocation, commands his Muse
to sing what she inspires in him; Vergil distinguishing one
from the other, prays his Muse to acquaint him with what
he is about to sing; whereas Ariosto, announcing simply
the subject of his songs, makes no invocation. It is evi-
dent that he relies upon himself, and that in the style that
he adopts he understands very well that he has no other
Muse, no other guide than his imagination. His subject
is in accord with his manner of treating it. If one wishes to
reflect upon this decisive point, one will feel and realize,
for the first time perhaps, why in the opinion of all the
world conceming two works from the same hand, Lo Pucelle
and La Henriade, the one is a poem, whereas the other, oom-
posed with afar greater pretension, is not. Voltaire, in
imitating Ariosto in a subject that he has rendered roman-
esque and frivolous, has received the second inspiration; but
in imitating Lucan in an historic subject he reoeived nothing,
