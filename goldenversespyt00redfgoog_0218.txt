meaning of these symbols take in the literal sense, what he
had said in the figurative. The philosopher blamed only
the excess, and permitted besides, a moderate usage ol all
the foods to which men were accustomed. Even the beans,
for which his disciples later conceived so much abhorrence‚
were caten frequently! He did not forbid absolutely either
wine, or meat, or even fish, whatever may have been as·

disciples who aspired to the highest perlection abstained
