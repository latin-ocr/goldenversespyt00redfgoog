206 The Golden Verses of Pythagoras

only a question then ol knowing what he ought, or ought
not to doubt: this is the true character oi the skeptic oi the

But although one may bring the absolute skeptic to agree
that a diffmenoe between good and evil can indoed exist,
as he is forced to agree that one does exist between that
which is and that which is not, just as I have demonstrated
in my preceding Exanrination; would he not be right in
saying, that to know in general, that good and evil oen differ
and consequently exist separately, does not prevent oon-
lounding them in particulam and that he oen doubt that
man may be able to make the distinction, until one may have
proved to him that not alone their knowledge, but that some
sort of knowledge is possible? Assuredly, this is pushing
doubt very lar. One could dispense with replying to this,
since the skeptic already interrogated concerning the differ·
euce existing between what is and what is not hasbeen
forced to admit it and to acquire thus some sort ol knowledge
of being; but let us forget this, in order to examine why
the savants oi Germany have inadequately removed a diffi-
culty which they have imposed upon themselves

It is Kant‚ one of the ablest minds that Europe has pro
duced since the extinction oi learning, wh0, resolved to
terminate with a single blow the struggle springing up
unceasingly between dogmatism and skepticism, has been
the first to form the bold project ol creating a science which
should determine, o priori, the possibility, the principles,
and the limits of all knowledge.⁰ This science, which he
named critical Philosophy, or method of judgment,⁰ he
has developed in several works of considerable length and
very difficult ol comprehension. I do not intend here to
