Examinations ol the Golden Verses 211

'ibe word Vernunst is applied to that sort oi faculty,
which consists in choosing at a distance, in wishing, in
selecting, in electing that which is good.⁰ It is expressed
by the word raison· but this expresses it very poorly, what·
ever may be the real meaning given it by Kant.

This philosopher ought to have realiaed more fully the
origin oi this word and he should have made a more just
application; then his system would have taken another
direction and he would have attained his goal. He would
have made us see, and he would have seen himself, the real·

above another thing. It becomes hasal in the Gennan word and has changed
the ph to st. From it is derived the Sason, English, Belgian, and Danish word
up, which expresses the movement ol everything which tends above. Also
from it, the German word lust, air, and the English word alost, that which ia

aa it carries it constantly in its analogue fem, that which is diatm. Likewiae
