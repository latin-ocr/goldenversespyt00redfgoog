248 The Golden Verses os Pythagoras

oi the Tritheists, is one of the most widespread on earth,
and one which has mingled most easily with the others. It
pleases the imagination aud gives to wisdom great power to
n'se to intelligible truths.

Ι have said that the Divinity, considered in the human
understanding, is manifest under the emblem oi two natural
principles: hence, all the cults wherein two opposed beings
appear, as in the cultos Zoroaster. This cult, which is
rarely enoountered as pure as among the ancient Persians,
or among the iollowers of Manes, mingles readily with
tritheism and even polytheism: it was quite recognizable
in Egypt and among the Scandinavians, and much more
involved among the Indians, Greeks, and Latins. This cult
could be considered as a natural Drbrrhy, and those who
follow it, Drbrrhists. Judgment and reason conform very
well in it; one also sees ordinarily, proiound reasoners and
skeptics, inclining there nolens volens! Its abuse leads to
atheism; but it offers great means, when one knows how to
make good use oi it, to penetrate the essence oi things and
sucoeed to the explanation oi natural phenomena.

Again I say, that the Divinity considered in the instinct
is presented* under the emblem oi material infinity: hence,
all cults where, by a contrary movement, the intelligible
becomes sentient and the sentient intelligible; as when the
attributes and iaculties of the Divinity are particularized
and personified, and as the agents of Nature, the parts of the
Universe and the individual beings themselves, are deified.
This cult, to which I have given the name oi Polytheism, is
everywhere, under different ionns and under different names,

three persons, whose image is man. All his doctrine is lirnited to leading, by
meditation and repression of the passions, the human ternary to its perfec-
tion. This ternary is composed, according to him, ol Kr', Tsing, and Chen,
that is to say, ol the material, animistic, and spiritual principle. It is neces·
sary that, being joined together, this ternary should make but One. Then
its duration will have no limit and its laculties will bc indestructible. Voycs
