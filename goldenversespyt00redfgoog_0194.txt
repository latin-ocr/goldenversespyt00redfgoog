pain, that is to say, whatever afflicts the body in its mortal
life, as veritable evils; they called veritable evils only sins,
vices, and errors into which one falls voluntarily. In their
opinion, the physical and inevitable evils being illustrated
by the presence of virtue, could be transformed into bless-
ings and become distinguished and enviable.⁰ These last
evils, dependent upon necessity, Lysis commended to be
judged for what they were; that is, to consider asan in·
evitable consequence of some mistake, as the chastisement
or remedy for some vice; and therefore to endure them, and
far from irritating them further by impatience and anger,
on the contrary to modify them by the resignation and ac·
quiescence of the will to the judgment of Providence. He
does not forbid, as one sees in the lines cited, assuaging
them by lawful means; on the contrary, he desires that the
sage should apply himself to diverting them if possible, and
healing them. Thus this philosopher did not fall into the
excess with which the Stoics have been justly reproached.⁶
He considered pain evil, not that it was of the same nature
as vice, but because its nature, a purgative for vice, makes
it a necessary consequence. Plato adopted this idea, and
made all the inferences felt with his customary eloquence.⁶

As to what Lysis said, always following Pythagoras,
that the sage was never exposed to the cruelest evils, this
can be understood as Hierocles has understood it, in a simple
and natural manner, or in a more mysterious manner as I
stated. It is evident at once, in following the inferences of
the principles which have been given, that the sage is not,
in reality, subject to the severest evils, since, not aggravat·
ing by his emotions those which the necessity of destiny

which he asserts that the prophetie oracles, having been consulted on this
subject, responded by these two liner from Homer:
“We accuse the gods of our evils, while we ourselves
By our own errors, are responsible for thern.”
