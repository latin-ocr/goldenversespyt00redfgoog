Examinations of the Golden Verses ²17

to excite their indifferenee. At that epoch, the philosophers
enveloped the truth with veih, and rendered the avenues of ¹·
science difficult, so that the vulgar might not profane them'.
They knew what had been too long forgotten: that all kinds
of wood are not fitting to make a Mercury. Also their
writers were obscure and sententious: in order to dishearten‚
not those who might be able to doubt, but those who were
not in a condition to comprehend.

Today, as the minds are changed, it is of more impor-
tance to attract those who are able to receive the truth, than
to keep at a distance those who are unable to receive it;
the latter, separating themselves, are persuaded that they
either possess it or have no need of it. Ι have given the
history of skepticism; Ι have shown its origin and the sorry
effects of its absolute and disordered influence; not in order
to bring back the skepties of the profession, but to endeavour
to prevent the men who are still drifting in uncertainty from
beooming so. I have essayed to show them by the example
of one of the greatest reasoners of Germany, by the example
of Kant, that reason alone, with whatever talents it may
he accompanied, cannot fail to lead them to nothingness.
I have made them see that this faculty so lauded is nothing
of itself. Ι am content with the example of the Koenigsberg
professor; but had Ι not feared prolixitios, I would have
added the example of Berkeley and that of Spinoza. The
varied catastrophos of these three savants form a striking
contrast. Kant, following step by step his pure Reason,
comes to seethat the knowledge of intelligible things is impos
sible and finds matter; Berkeley, led hythe same reason,
proves that the existence of matter is illusory, and that allis
spirit; Spinoza, drawing irresistibleargumentsfrom thissame
faculty, shows that there exists and can exist only one sole
substance and that therefore spirit and matter are but one,
And do not think that, armed with reason alone, you oen
combat separately Spinoaa, Berkeley, or Kant: their oon-

tradietory systems will clash in vaim they will triumph
