consider man under three principal faculties‚ states them;
without saying to what particular modification he at-

In order to express these three facrdties Kant makes
use of three words taken trom his own tongue and concern-
ing the meaning of which it is well to fix our attention. He
has named the first ol these laculties Empfindlichkeit, the
second, Verrem, and the third, Vernunft. These three
words are exoellent; it is only a question ol clearly under·
standing and explaining them.

The word Empfindlichkeit expresses that sort ol facidty
which consists in collecting from without, feeling from within,
and finding good or bad.⁸ It has beenvery well rendered
in French by the word sensibtldi.

The word Verstond designates that sort ol faculty which

consists in reaching alar, being carried irom a central point
to all other points of the circumference to seiae them.b

It has been quite well rendered in French by the word
entendement.

its remote root is hand, the seat oi touch, whence comes finger, that which

lest root, becoming nasal at the final and aspirate at the initial. has produoed
tane song, a capture, and find, a discovery. The syllable emp, which precedes
the root find. expresses the movement which lifts up from below;liclrdesig11ates

tThe root ol this word is stand, a fixed thing, a state; its remote root is
slot, that which is permanent. Its primitive root is ’Μ (shdod), eminere,
force, constancy. The initial syllable uer expresses the movement which
carries lar away, which transports from the place where one is, to that where
one is not.
