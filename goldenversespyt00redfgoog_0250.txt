Examinations ol the Golden Verses 227

Drawn on by my subject, I have lorgotten to say that,
according to Porphyry, there is lacking in the Golden Verses
as given by Hierocles, two lines which ought to be placed
immediately before those which open the unitive part ol
the doctrine of Pythagoras called persectrbm these are ⁰:

upon alr ἐξ ὕπνοιο μελίφρονος ἐξ ὑπῆσαν,
Ἐν μάλα mcxvii! δυ’ ἐν maye im solcum.

On the moment ol awakening, consider calmly
What are thy duties, and what thou shouldst accomplisb.

These lines, which express the general outline of this last ·
part, are remarkable, and one cannot conceive how Hierocles
could have overlooked or neglected them. Although,
it is true, they add nothing in the literal sense, they say
much, however, in the figurative sense; they serve as procl
ol the division of this poem, which Hierocles himself has
adopted without explanation. Lysis indicates quite strongly
that he is about to pass on to a new teaching: he calls the
attention of the disciple ol Pythagoras to the new career
which is opened before him, and to the means of traversing
it and of attaining to the divine virtues which must crown
it. This means is the knowledge ol onesell, as I have said,
This knowledge, so commended by the ancient sagas, so
exalted by them, which must open the avenues ol all the
others and deliver to them the key of the mysteries ol nature
and the doors ol the Universe; this knowledge, I say, could
not be exposed unveiled at the epoch when Pythagoras
lived, on account ol the secrets that it would ol necessity
betray. Likewise this philosopher had the habit ol pro
claiming it under'the emblem of the sacred Tetrad or of the
Quatemary. This is why Lysis, in invoking the name oi
his master, designates iton this occasion with the most
stn'king characteristic ol his doctrine. “I swear,” he said,
“by the one who has revealed to our soul the knowledge ol
the Tetrad, that source of eternal Nature”: that is to say,

aporphyr, voram.
