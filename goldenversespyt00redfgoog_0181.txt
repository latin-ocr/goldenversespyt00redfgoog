158 The Golden Verses ol Pythagoras

started from this axiom that nothing is made from nothing·
The former sought the how, and the latter the why ol things;
and all were united in saying that there is no effect without

· cause. Their different systems, based upon the principles

oi reasoning which seemed incontestable‚ and supported by
a series ol imposing conclusione had, at first, a prodigious
success; but this belot paled considerably when soon the dis·
ciples of Pythagoras, and a little later those oi Socrates and
Plato, having received from their masters the theosophical
tradition, stopped these sophistica] physicists in the midst
of their triumphs, and, asking them the cause of physical
and of moral evil, proved to them that they knew nothing
of it; and that, in whatever fashion they might deduce it by
their system, they could not avoid establishing an absolute
fatality‚ destructive to the liberty of man, which by depriv-
ing it of morality of actions, by confounding vice and virtue,
ignorance and wisdom, made ol the Universe no more than
a frightful chaos. In vain these had thrust back the re-
proach and clauned that the inference was false; their ad·
versaries pursuing them on their own ground cried out to
them: Il the principle that you admit is good, whence comes
it that men are wicked and miserable?⁶ Il this unique
principle is bad, whence emerge goodness and virtue?‘
If nature is the expression oi this sole principle, how is it
not constant and why does its govemment sow goodness
and evil?‘1 The materialists had recourse vainly to a
certain deviation in atoms,‘ and the spiritualists‚ to a
certain adjuvant cause quite similar to efficacious graces;
Ι the theosophists would never have renouneed them if they
