developments in Greece to Orpheus, its second to Homer,
and its last to AEschylus. These three creative men, seizing
the different germs of this science still shrouded in their
formless rudiments, warmed them with the fire of their ¹
genius aud according to the particular inspiration of each,
led them to the perfectiori of which they were susceptible.
All three of them were the object of a first inspiration,
although influenocd one by the other, and were able to
communicate the magnetic power to new disciples. Orpheus
possessor of intellectual and rational poetry, constituted
mat which Ι call Eumolpaeiu, which, being divided into
theosophy and philosophy, produces all the works which
treat of the Divinity‚ of the Universe, of Nature, and of
Man in general* Homer, in joining to this spiritual poetry
the enthusiasm of the passione, created Epopoeia, whose
magnificent genus envelops a multitude of specie, where
· the intellectual faculty and passion dominate with more or
less energy under the influence of imagination. Homer
rendered sentient that which was' intelligible and particu-
larized that which Orpheus had left universal: AEschylus,
trying to bring into action what these two divine men had
left with potentiality, formed the idea of dramatic or active
poetry, in which he claimed to include whatever Eumolpoeia
and Epopoeia had in common, that was moral, allegorical,
and passionate. He would have succeeded, perhaps, and
then would have produced the most perfect work of thought,
passion, and action possible for men, conceived by genius
and executed by talent; but Greece, exhausted by the abun·
dant harvest obtained by Orpheus and Homer, laeked the
sap to give nourishment to this new plant. Corrupted in
·its germ, this plant degenerated rapidly‚ deteriorated, and
put forth only a vain show of branches without elevation
and without virtue. The heroes of Thermopyla succumbed
under the burden of their laurels. Given over to a foolish
