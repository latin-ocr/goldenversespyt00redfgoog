Examinations ol the Golden Verses 143

it is Nature that presides at our birth, that gives us a father,
a mother, brothers, sisters, relations of kinship, a position
upon the earth, and a place in society; all this depends not
upon us: all this, according tn the vulgar, is the work of
hazard; but according to the Pythagoream philosopher these
are the consequences of an anterior order, severe and irre·
sistible, called Fortune or Necessity. Pythagoras opposed
to this restrained nature, a free Nature, which, acting upon
forced things as upon brute matter, modifies them and
draws as it wills, good or bad results. This second nature
was called Power or Will: it is this which rules the life of
man, and which directs his conduct according to the ele·
ments furnished him by the first. Necessity and Power
are, according to Pythagoras, the two opposed motives of
the sublunary world where man is relegated. These two
motives draw their force from a superior cause that the
ancients named Nemesis, the fundamental decree,⁰ that
we name Proridence. Thus then, Pythagoras recognized,
relative to man, things constrained and things free, according
as they depend upon Necessity or the Will: he ranked filial
piety in the first and friendship in the second. Man not
being free to give himself parents of his choice, must honour
them such as they are, and fulfil in regard to thern all the
duties of nature, whatever wrong they might do towards
him, but as nothing constrains him from giving his friend-
ship, he need give it only to the one who shows himself
worthy of it by his attachment to virtue.

Let us observe an important point. In China where
filial piety is regarded as the root of all virtues and the first ,
source of instruction,b the exercise of the duties which
it imposes admits of no exception. As the legislator teaches

⁰ Nemesis, in Greek nemis, is derived lrom the Phoenician words nst
(nom or nem), expressing every judgrnent, every order, every decree announoed
by word ol mouth; and m (esbirle), all that serves lor principle, asloundation.
This last word has root vn (as, os, or es).
