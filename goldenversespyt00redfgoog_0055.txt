3² The Golden Verses os Pythagoras

brated cosmogony was found,¹ in which an astronomical
system was developed that would be an honour to our
century, touching the plurality ol the worlds‚ the station of
the sun at the centre oi the universe, and the habitationoi
the stars.² These extraordinary works emanated from the
same genius who had written in verse upon grammar, music,

and Epimenides, but even as that of Homer, AEschylus, and
Pindar. I do not pretend, in saying this, to take away

who indicates a course, yields to the one who executes it:

now this, especially, is what Homer did.
