causes which prolong the duration of empires. Filial piety
is the national virtue of the Chinese, the sacred foundation
upon which reposce the social edifica of the greatest and the

of heaven seated upon the imperial throne, animatas all
the hearts with a sacred fire, of which Nature herself pro·

one’s relations; he says to choose one's friends. This is why:
