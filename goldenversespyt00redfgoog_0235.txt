212 The Golden Verses ol Pythagoras

1 cannot conceive how Kant, by giving the word Vernunft,
the meaning ol the Latin word ratio, has been able to say
thet it is the highest degree oi the activity of a mind which
has the power oi all its liberty, and the consciousneee oi all
its strength⁶: there is nothing more false. Reason does
not exist in liberty, but on the contrary, in necessity. Its
movement, which is geometric, is always forced: itis an
inferenoc from the point oi departure, and nothing more.
Let us examine this carelully. The Latin word ratio, whose
meaning Kant has visibly followed, has never translated
exactly the Greek word logos, in the sense of word· and
ii the Greek philosophers have substituted sometimes the
logos for nour, or the word for the intelligence, by taking
the effect for the cause, it is wrong when the Romans have
tried to imitate them, by using ratio, in place oi mens, or
intelligentia. In this they have proved their ignorance and
have disclosed the calamitous ravages that skepticism had
already made among them. The word ratio springs from
the root ro or rol, which in all the tongues where it has been
received, has carried the idea of a roy, a straight line drawn
from one point ιο another.‘ Thus reason, iar irom being
free as Kant has pretended is what is the most con·
strained in nature: it is a geometric line, always subject to
the point whence it emanates, and forced to strike the point
toward which it is directed under penalty oi ceasing ιο be
itseli; that is to say, of ceasing to be straight. Now, reason
not being free in its course, is neither good nor bad in itself ;
it is always analogous to the principle ot which it is the

‘In the Oriental languages ti (rou) indicates the visua] ray, and 'n
(rod), all movement which is detennined upon a straight line. This root,
aceompanied by a guttural inflection, is called recht, in German, and right
in English and Saron. The Latios made oi it rectum, that which is straight.
In French rotun and rcteou. The Teutons, taking right in a figurative sense,
heve drawn from this same root, rolli, a council, and richen a judge.
