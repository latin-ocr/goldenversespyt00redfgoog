With prudente the Philosopher opproocs or blomcw

It is sufficiently known that Pythagoras was the first
who used the word Philosopher to designate o friend os rw's·
dom! Before him, the word Sophos, sage, was used. It
is therefore with intention that Ι have made it enter into
my translation, although it may not be literally in the text.
The portrayal that Lysis gives of the philosopher represents
everything in moderation andin that just mean, where the
celebrated Kong-Tse placed also the perfectiori of the sage.‘
He commended to him tolerance for the opinions of others,
instilling in him that, as truth and error have likewise their
followerS, one must not be flattered into thinking that one
can enlighten all men, nor bring them to accept the same
sentiments and to profess the same doctrine. Pythagoras
had, following his custom, expressed these same ideas by
symbolic phrases: “Exceed not the balance,'' he had said,
“stir not the hre with the sword,'' “all materials are not
fitting to make a statue of Mercury.” That is to say, avoid
all excess; depart not from the golden mean which is the
appanage of the philosopher; propagate not your doctrine
by violent means; use not the sword in the cause of God and
the truth; confide not science to a corrupt sonl; or as Jesus
forcibly said: “Give not that which is holy unto the dogs
neither cast ye your pearls before swine'’⁶; for all men
