The Essence and Form ol Poetry 19

Delphi.¹ But itscemsthat the universality of this OEtolinos
was never well understood by the Greeks, who, in their
minds, united only with difficulty that which custcm and
their sensas had taught them to separate. Moreover one
can well conjecture that, as in all religious schisms, a host

with blood. But here is not the place to touch upon one oi
the most important and most singular facts of the history
of man. Ihave already deviated too much from my sub

considered as a particular being. Thence, so many of the
demi-gods, and the celebrated heroes, from whom the Greek
tribes pretended to have descended; thence, so many of
the famous poets to whom were attributed a mass of works
that emanated from the same sanctuary, or were composed
