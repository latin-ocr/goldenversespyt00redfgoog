104 The Golden Verses ol Pythagoras

in Greek, was inspired by Homer; while, on the contrary, it
was Shakespeare who inspired Milton. Itis known that
Paradise Losl was at first conceived as the subject of a
tragedy, and that it was only after reflection that the Eng-
lish poet saw therein the material for an epic poem. I will
tell later on, in speaking of the Messiolr of Klopstock, what
has prevented these two subjects, which appear equally
epics, from attaining wholly to the majesty of epopoeia.
As many of the motives that Ι have to offer apply to the
two works, I will thus avoid useless repetition. I shall
begin by translating the exposition and invocation of Milton,
by imitating its movement and its harmony, as I have done
with the other poets.

De l'homme, viens chanter la disgrace, et la fruit
Decet arbre fatal, dont le gollt homicide
Livra le Monde au crime, ila mort, aux malheurs,
Et nous ravit Eden, jusqn’au moment qu'un Homme
Plus grand, par son trepas, racheta le sejour

in the spirit oi its govemment and its superstitious cult. They have all
thought that the tribunal oi the Inquisition alone was capable ol arresting the
impulse of genius and ol stilling the development oi learning. In this they
have taken ellects lor causes, and consequences for principles. They have
notseenthat the spirit ol the government and the cnlt is always not the motive,
but the result of the national spirit, and that the wealth and the oolonies,
indifferent in themselves, are only instruments that this spirit employs for
good or evil, according to its character. I can only indicate the first muse
which has prevented Spain lrom reaching the culminating point which France
is very near to attaining. This cause is pride. Whilst Europe, enveloped
in darhress, was, so to speak, in the fennentation ol ignorance, Spain, con·
qnered by the Arabs, received a germ ol science which, developing with ra·
pidity, produced a precocious lruit, brilliant, but like hot-house fruit lacking
intemal force and generative vigour. This premature productiori having
raised Spain abruptly above the other European natione, inspired in her that
pride, that excessive amour propre which, making her treat with contempt
all that did not belong to her, hindered her from making any change in her
usual customs, carried her with complacency in her mistakes, and when other
peoples came to bring forth iruits in their season, corrupted hers and stamped
her with a stationary movement, which beooming necessarily retrogressive,
must ruin her, and did ruin her.
