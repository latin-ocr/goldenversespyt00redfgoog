90 The Golden Verses ol Pythagoras

Arms and the manl sing, who first,
By fate ol Ilium realm amerced,
To fair Italia onward bore,
And lauded on Lavinium's shore :-
Long tossing earth and ocean o'er,
By violence ol heaven, to sate
Fell Juno’s unforgetting hate:
Much laboured too in battle-field,
Striving his city’s walls to build,

And give his Gods ahorne:
Thence come the hardy Latin brood,
The ancient sires of Alba’s blood,

And lofty·rampired Rome.
Say, Muse, for godhead how disdained,
Or wherefore worth, Heaven⁴s queen constrained
That soul ol piety so long
To turn the wheel, to eope with wrong.
Can heavenly natures nourish hate

So fierce, so blindly passionate?
Conium.

Arma virumque cano, Troiae qui primus ab oris
Italiam, fato profugus, Lavinaque venit
Litora, multum ille et terris jactatus et alto
Vi superum, saevae memorem Junonis ob iram,
Multa quoque et bello passus, dum conderet urbem
Inferretque deos Latio: genus unde Latinum,
Albanique patres atque altae moenia Romae.
Musa, mihi causas memora, quo numine laeso,
Quidve dolens, regina deum tot volvere casus
Insignem pietate virum, tot adire labores
Impulerit. Tantaene animis coelestibus irae?

It can be observed that Vergil, although he places him-
self foremost and although he says, I sing, begins never-
theless in a manner much less animated, much less sure than
the Greek poet, wh0, transported beyond himself, seems to
impose upon his Muse the subject of his songs‚ interrogatas
her, and then inspired by her, responds. The Latin poet
finisheS, like his model, with a sentence; but it is easy to feel
that this apostrophe.
