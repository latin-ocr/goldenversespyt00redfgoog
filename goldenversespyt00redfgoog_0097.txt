where this might be possible, he did not see how this rhythm
could be conformable to that of the Greeks and Latius.¹

am furthermore en partie, on what he says of the rhyme.
Ι know as he, that it is not an invention ol the barbarous
agen 1 know even more, that it is the luxurious production
ol a very enlightened age; Ι must say that it has brought
forth thousands of beautiful verses, that it is often to the

, poet like a strange genius which comes to the assistance oi

his own.² God forbid that I pretend-to separate it from
Fnench verse ol which it is a charm. Rhyme is necessary,
even indispensable‚ to romantio poetry and to all that is

harmony which accords with it. All the secondary styles

ornament of dramatic art such as we possess—that is to say,
chivalrous and impassioned; but as to real Eumolpoeia and
Epopoeia-that is to say, as to what concems intellectual
and rational poetry, pure or mingled with the enthusiasm
ol the passions; prophetie verses or hymns emanated from
the Divinity or destined to be raised to it; philosophical
verse adapted to the, nature of things and developing the
diverse moral and physical systems; epic verses uniting
talent t0 allegorical genius and joining together the intel-

incompatible. As much as it delights in works oi the mind
just so much is it rejected by genius. Fiction harmonizes
with it, allegory is opposed to it. It is chivalrous and not
