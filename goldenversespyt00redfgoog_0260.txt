them that it is not a question of knowing how nor why it ,
makes things, but only that it makes them; which is proved
by the overthrow of their dilemma; and which, aiter nil,
is saying with more reason in this circumstance than in any
other, that time has nothing to do with the affair, since it
is nothing to Providence, although for us it may be much.

And ii, continuing to draw imerencee from your reason·
ing, the skeptioe say to you that, according to the continual
effusion of good which you establish the sum ought to be
daily augmented, whilst that of evil, diminishing in the
same proportion, ought at last to disappcar wholly, which
they cannot believe; reply, that the inferencee of a reason-
ing which ooniounds theirs are at their disposui: that they
can deduce from them as much as they wish; without en-
gaging you, for that matter, to discuss the extent of their
view, either in the past, or in the future, because each one
has his own; that, besides, you owe it to truth to teach thern
that the dogma, by means of which you have ruined the
laborious structure of their logie, is no other than a theo·
sophical tradition, universally received from one end of the
earth to the other, as it is easy to prove to them.

Open the sacred books of the Chinese, the Burmans,
Indians, and Persians, you will find there the unequivocal
traces of this dogma. Here, it is Providenoe represented
under the traits os a celestial virgin, who, sent by the Su-
preme Being, furnished arms to combat and to subjugate the
genius of evil, and to bring to perfection everything that it
had corrupted!⁸ Tbere, it is the Universe itself and the
Worlds which compose it, which are signaiized as the instru-
ment employed by this same Providenoe to attain this end.⁶
