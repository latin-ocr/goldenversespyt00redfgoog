72 The Golden Verses ol Pythagoras

verses subjected to rhyme are incapable in any tongue ol
attaining the sublime heights oi Eumolpoeia or of Epopoeia.
The French poets soon proved it, when coming to un·
derstand the works oi Homer and Vergil, they thought them-
selves able to imitate them by making use oi the same poetic
forms by which the authors oi Perceoal or Bertheuu-grond-
piel had profited. It was all to no purpose that they worked
these lorms, striking them upon the auvil, polishing them,

and repolishing the rhyme, tearing to pieces and revising
twenty times their works, and finally bringing the lorm to
