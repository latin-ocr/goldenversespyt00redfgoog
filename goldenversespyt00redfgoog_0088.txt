It was a very remarkable epoch, Messieurs, which saw
puuped about it in the space of less than a hali century
mdcoincident with the downlall oi the Empire of the Orient,
the use of gunpowder, of the compass, ol the telescope in
the Occidens, the invention cf engraving upon copper, that
ci novablecharactersfor printing, the extension oi commerce
and navigation by the passage arcund the cape of Storms‚
and finally the discovery ci America. It was a very extra·
ordinary century, in which were born Mohammed 11. and
lorenzo de’ Medici, Vasco da Gama and Christopher Colum·
bns, Theodoros Gaza and Pico della Mirandola, Leonardo
da Vinci and Bojardo, Leo X. and Luther. After the inva-
sion οἱ the barbarians, Christian Europe had lost its political
nnity: it was as a great republic whose divided members,
stmggling continuously one against the other, tearing by
turn a shadow of supremacy, were the realms, the pontifical
or laic principalities, the republics, the free and commercial
citios. The two chiefs ol this gigantic and badly organized
body, the German Emperor and the Pope, bishop ol Rome,
were vested only with a grandeur of opinion ; their real power
was void: they were nothing more, in lact, than that which
they appeared in form. Since Charlemagne, who, in a
century of darkness enlightened with his own genius, had
had the force to grasp the debris ol the empire, uniting them
in hishand and giving them a momentary existence, it had
not had an emperor. The vain efforts ol Hildebrand and
oi charles V. had served only at different times and under
different conditions to demonstrate their impotence. It
was reserved for a much greater man to dominata Europe
regenerated by violent shocks, and to show to the universe
the legitimate successor ol Augustus wreathed with the

imperial crown.
