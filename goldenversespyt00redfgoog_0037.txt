etymologias which can be regarded as the fundamental
points of the history of poetry, it is necessary to remember,
first, that the Phoenicians, at the epoch when they covered
not only Greece but the coasts of the rest of Europe with
their colonies, brought there their language, and gave their
names to the countries of which they had taken possessiom
seeondly, that these names drawn almost always from ob·
jects symbolic of their cult, constituted ior these countries
