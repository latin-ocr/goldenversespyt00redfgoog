’ Examinations ol the Golden Verses ²05

just spoken. A simple question put to a skeptic philosopher
will indicate whether be belongs ιο the school of Socrates
or Pyrrho. He must before entering into any discussion
reply clearly to this demand: Do you admit of any difference
whatever between that which is and that which is not? Ii
the skeptic belongs to the school ol Socrates, he will neces·
sarily admit a difference and he will explain it, which will
make him recognized at once. If on the contrary, he be-
longs to that of Pyrrho, he will respond in one of three ways:
either that he admits a difference, or that he admits none,
or that he does not know whether one exists. If he admits
it without explaining it, he is beaten; if he does not admit it,
he falls into absurdity; if he pretends not to distinguish it,
he becomes icolish and ridiculous.

lle is beaten, ii he admits a difference between that
which is and that which is not; because that difference,
admitted, proves the existence oi being; the existence ot
being proves that oi the skeptic who replies; and that
existence proved, proves all the others, whether one considers
them in him, or ontside ot him, which is the same thing lor
the moment.

He falls into absurdity, if he does not admit any difler-
enoe between that which is and that which is not, for then
one can prove ιο him that 1 is equal to 0, and that the part
is as great as the whole.

He becomes foolish and ridiculous, il he dares to say that
he does not know whether a difference really exists between
that which is, and that which is not; lor then one asks him
what he did at the age ol six months, at one year, two
years, two weeks ago, yesterday? Whatever he replies, he
will become the object of ridicule.

Behold the Pyrrhonian beaten, that is to say, the one
who professes to doubt everything; since a single acknow·
ledged difference bringing him irresistibly toa certainty.
and since one certainty militates against all the others, there
is no further doubt: and since, doubting no further, itis
