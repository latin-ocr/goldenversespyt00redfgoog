³8 The Golden Verses ol Pythagoras

the principle oi generation from that oi thought, on account
of which the moral and physica] passions declare war. But
it would be taking me too lar away from my subject, exam·
ining in detail what might be the meaning ol the allegories
ol Homer. My plan has not been to investigate this mean-
ing in particular, but to show that it exists in general.
Upon this point Ι have not only the rational proof which
results from the concatenation oi my ideas, but also prool
of the fact, which is furnished to me by the testimonials of
the ancients. These testimonials are recognized at every
step, in the works of the philosophers and chiefly in those
of the Stoice. Only a very supen‘icial erudition is necessary
to be convinced oi this.¹ But I ought to make an observa· ’

50), to express the genitive case, in this manner, utu-hmo (menei-loiri),
the rational famssty or regulatur ol the being in general, and man in
partierrlar: lor vv, vlu, w, ml (asli, absh, ish, abb), signifies equally fire,
principle, being, and mun. The etymology oi these three words can, as one
sees, throw grean light upon the table ol the iliud. llere isanother remarkable
point on this subject. Homer has never used, to designate the Greeks, the
name of Hellenos, that is to say, the resplendente, or the lunare: it was in his
time quite a new name, which the oenlederated Greeks had taken to resist
foreign attack; it is only in the Odyssey, and when he is already old, that he
employs the name Helius tc designate Greece. The name which he gives
constantly to this country, is that oi Achaia (Ἂχαϊσ), and he opposes it to
that oi Troy (Ἔρως now, Achaia signifies the strong, the igneous, the
spirituak and Troy, the terrestrial, the gross. The Phoenician roots are tlh
(etti), the exbaling force oi fire, and ,thu (tro) the balancing power ol the
earth. Refer, in this regard, to Court de Gebelin (me. prim, t. vi.. p. 64).
Pomponius Sabinus, in his Commentuires sur l'liniide, said that the name
ol the city oi Troy signified a sow, and he adds that the Troians had lor an
ensign a sow embruidered in gold.

As to the word Ilion, which was the sacred name ol Troy, it is very easy
to recognize the name oi the material principle, called ὕλη (ute) by the Greeks
and yles by the Egyptians. lamblichus speaks oi it at grem length in his
Book on the Mysaries (i 7), as the principle lrom which all has birth: this was
also the opinion oi Porphyry (Euseb.,1>roep. Euang.. l. ir.¹ c. 9 and η).
