be reduced to these lew words. The sole remedy for evil,
whatever may be the cause, is time. Providenoe, minister
of the Most High, employs this rernedy; and by means ol
perfectibility which results from it, brings back all to good
But the aptitude of the maledieo for receiving it acts in
proportion to this remedy. Time, always the same, and
always nihil for the Divinity is, however, shortened or
lengthened lor men, according as their will coincides with the
providentia] action or differs therefrom. They have only to
desire good, and time which latigues them will be lightened

towards the good? The will of man is free beyond doubt; and
its essence, immutable as the Divinity whenoe it emanatas,
knows not how to be changed, but nothing is impossible for
God. The change which is effected in it, without which its
irnmutability may in no wise be altered, is the miracle of the
All-Powerful. It is a result of its own liberty, and if Ι dare
to say it, takes place by the coincidence of two movements,
whose impulse is given by Providence; by the first, it shows
to the will goodness; by the second, it puts it in a fitting
position to meet this same goodness.

35. Nature serves them. . . .

Lysis expresses it thus: Nature, by the homogeneity
which, as Ι have stated, constitutes its essence, teaches men
to see beyond the range oi their senseS, transports them by
analogy from one region to another and develops their ideas
The perfectibility which is manifested through the grace of
time is called perfection; ior the more a thing is perfected
the more perfect it becomes. The man who perceives this is
struck by it, and ii he reflect he finds truth, as I have openly
