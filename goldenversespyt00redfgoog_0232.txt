Examinations of the Golden Verses 209

aside more and more from the right line proportionably as
it is prolonged, is lound to strike at an euormous distance
from the mark where Kant hoped it would arrive. This
deviating point-who would have believed it-is lound in
the misinterpretation and the misapplication ol a word·

Kant, whether through imitation ol the ancient philo

lThe idea ol making the quatemary spring lrom the unity, and the
decade lrom the quaternary is expressed literally in the following lines ol
Pythagoras, preserved by Proclus:
