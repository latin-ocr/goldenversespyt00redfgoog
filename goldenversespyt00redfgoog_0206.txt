united the science ol genethlialogy or astrology with the
priesthood, and concealed with care the principles ol this
science within the precincts of the sanctuary.⁰ It was
a Secret ol State among the Etruscans and at Rome,l as

confide its elements except to those whom they deemed
worthy to be initiated.⁴ For one need only lay aside an

for us today, being wholly unlmown, have none the less

that he has traced lor himself, man would be able not only
to recognize the imprints ol his steps, but to foresee the
objects that he is about to encounter, since he has already
seen them, if his memory preserved the image, and if this
image was not effaced by the necessary consequence of his
nature and the providential laws which rule him. Such is
