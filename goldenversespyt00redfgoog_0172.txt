ridiculous that his enemies had drawn from certain equivocal
phrases! What persuades me to make this observation,
is because it has been proved that Manes had indeed ad-

passage ol the Zered-Acesta, where in contemplation of the Suprema Being,
producet ot Orrnuzd, he caus this Being, the Being absorberi in mallem.

this Being and Orrnuzd (36⁸ lud du Vendidad Sede, p. 180, 19⁶ snrgord, p. 415),
One finds in another book, called Sloristhu, that when this Supreme Being
organined the matter oi the Universe, he projected his Will in the lorm ol a
