The Essence and Form of Poetry 29

upon the unity of God, but the differem circumstances in
which he found himself placed did not permit him to divulge
this dogma3 he reserved this for making it the basis of his
myster-ies, and continued, in the meantime, to personify in
his poetry the attributes of the Divinity. His institutions,
drawn from the same source, founded upon the same truths,
received the imprint of his character and that of the pecple
to whom he had destined thern. As those of Moses were
severe and, if one must admit, harsh in form, enemies of the
scienoes and arts, so those of Orpheus were brilliant, fitted
to seduce the minds, favourable to all the developments
cf the imagination. It was beneath the allurements of
pleasure, cf joy, and of setes, that he concealed the utility
cf his lesscns and the depth of his doctrine. Nothing was
more full cf pomp than the celebration of its mysteries.

painting had, was used to excite the enthusiasrn of the

which he proclaimed. These truths, whose force the early
Christians have recognized‚¹ went much further than those
of which Moses had been the interpretem they seemed to
anticipate the times. Not only did he teach of the unity
of God,* and give the most sublime ideas of this unfathom-
able Being³; not only did he explain the birth of the Universe
and the origin of things⁴; but he represented this unique
God under the emblem cf a mysterious Trinity endowed
