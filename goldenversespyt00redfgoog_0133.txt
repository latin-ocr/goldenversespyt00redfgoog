110 The Golden Verses 01 Pythagoras

shame, and the interest that one devotes to him reflects
upon Achilles and can even be increased. The gods are
divided; but Venus and Juno, Minerva and Mars, Vulcan
and Neptune are 01 a like nature; and although divided in
the epic action, they are none the less venerated by both
parties, equal among each other and all equally subject to
Jupiter, who excites or checks their resentment. I know
not whether any one has already made this observation;
but be that as it may, it is very important. One can attain
to the sublimity 01 epopoeia only if like Homer one knows
how to oppose the Powers which serve the hero with the

only slightly so that you may feel, Massicum, notwith-

and there; but no poet since Vergil, has leit the imprint
01 his steps upon the true path. The moment is perhaps at
hand 101 gathering the palms that time has n'pened. Must
this century, great in prodigies, remain without an impas-
sioned and enchanting voice to sing 01 them? Assuredly
not. Whoever may be the poet whose genius raises itself
to this noble task, I have wished from afar to lend him my
feeble support; ior I have often enough repeated, that
