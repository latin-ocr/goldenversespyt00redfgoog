Examinations of the Golden Verses 267

creatores, by endowing them with as much knowledge, happiness
and beauty as tbe Universa might admit without going away
from tbe immutable order established by his wisdom.⁰

Up to this point, the system oi Leibnitz sustained itself,
and was able even to lead to a relative truth, but its work
was not accomplished. It was necessary to explain, follow-
ing the demand of Epicurus so much repeated by Bayle, how
in this immutable order established by the divine Wisdom
· in this best of worlds, that physical and moral evil make felt
such severe effects. The German philosopher, instead ol
stopping at these effecte, and stating the primordia] cause,
inaccessible to his researches, still soorned it, as had all the
adversaries of Bayle, and asserted that physical and moral
evils were necessary to maintain this immutable order, and
entered into the plan of this best of worlds. Fatal assertion
which overthrew his system instantly: lor, how dares one
to say that evil is necessary, and above all necessary not
only in what is best, but in what is the best possiblel

Now, whatever may be the primordial cause oi Evil,
oonoerning which 1 can not nor do 1 wish to explain myseli,
until the triple veil, extended over this formidable mystery
by Moses, may have been raised, 1 will say, according to the
doctrine oi Pythagoras and Plat0, that its effects can be
neither necessary, nor irresistible since they are not immut-
able andlwillreplytothe much-lauded argument of Epicurus,
that by this very thing they are neither necessary nor
irresistible; God can and will remove them and he does
remove thern. ⁷

And if certain disciples of Bayle, astonished by a reply
so bold and so new, asked me when and how God works so
great a benefit, of which they have perceived no traces, I
will say to them: by time and by means of perfectibility.
Time is the instrument of Providence; perfectibility, the
plan of its work; Nature, the object of its labour; and Good.
