126 The Golden Verses ol Pythagoras

retired into Greece, where, wishing to spread the sect of
Pythagoras, to whose principles calumnier had been at·
tached, he ielt it necessary to set up a sort oi formulary
which would contain the basis oi morals and the principal
rules oi conduct given by this celebrated man. It is to this
generous movement that we owe the philosophical verses
that Ι have essayed to translate into Foench. These verses,

who is the author of them, obtained so much celebrity in
Graece that he was honoured as the master and friend of
Epaminondas! If his name has not been attached to
this work, it is because at the epoch when he wrote it, the
ancient custom still existed of considering things and not
individuals: it was with the doctrine of Pythagoras that
one was concerned, and not with the talent of Lysis which
