to prove to me that he understood at least what he found so
unworthy oi taking up his time; but that was the thing
about which he thought the least. Open whatever book
you will; if the authors are theologiam, they will say to you
that Socrates, Pythagoras Zoroaster, Kong-Tse or ConiuciuS,
as they call him, are pagans,⁰ whose damnation is, ii not
certain, at least very probable; they will treat their theoso-
phy with the most profound contempt: ii they are physicists,
they will assure you that Thales, Leucippus, Heraclitus,
Parmenides, Anaxagoras, Empedocles, Aristotle, and the
others are miserable dreamers;they will jeer at their systems:
if they are astronomers, they will laugh at their astronomy:
ii they are naturalists, chemists, botanists, they will make
jest oi their methods, and will take into consideration their
credulity, their stupidity, their bad saith, the numerous
wonders that they no longer understand in Aristotle and
in Pliny. N one will take the trouble to prove their asser-
tions; but, like people blinded by passion and ignorance,
they state as iact what is in question, or putting their own
ideas in place of those that they do not understand they
will create phantoms ior the sake of fighting them. Never
going back to the principles oi anything, stopping only at
forms, adopting without examination the commonest no·
tions, they will commit on all sides the same mistake that

⁶ The name oi Pogon isan injurious and ignoble term derived from the
Latin Pogonus, which signides a rustic, a peasant. When Christianity had
entirely triumphed over Greek and Roman polytheism, and when by the order
oi the Emperor Theodosius, the lost temple dedicated to the gods oi the
natione had been destroyed in the citios, it was found that the people in the
country still persisted a considerable time in the ancient cult, which caused
them and all their imitators to be called derisively Pogons. This appellationi,
which could suit the Greeks and Romans in the fiitb century who refused to
submit to the dominating religion in the Empire, is false and ridiculous when
one mtends it to other times, and to other peoples. It cannot be said without
at once offending chronology and common sense, that the Romans or Greeks
oi the time oi Casar, oi Alexander, or oi Periclem the Persians, Arabs, Egyp-
tians, Indians, the Chinese, ancient or modern, were Pagone· that is to say,
peasants disobedient to the laws oi Theodosius. These are polythe'uts, mono·
theists, mythologists, whatever one wishes, idolators perhaps, but not Pagone.
