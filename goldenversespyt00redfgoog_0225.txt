202 The Golden Verses of l³ythagoras

lineos Homer: “Even as are the generations of leaves such
are those likewise of men.”‘

I pause a moment here, in order that the reader may
observa, that although the thought oi Hesiod, concerning
theveilthatthe godshadspreedbetweenthemandmen,
and which gave rise to Arcesilaus establishing his acata-
lepsy, had originated in India? it had never had the same
results there; and this, because the Brahmans, in teaching
that this veil existed and that it even bewildered the vulgar
by a series of illusory phenomena, have never said that it
was impossible to raise it; because this might have been an
attack on the power of the will of man and its perfectibility,
to which they put no limit. We shall see further on that
such was also the idea of Pythagoras. Itet us return to the
Skeptics.

The writer to whom we owe a comparative history ol
the systems of philosophy, written with thought and im-
partiality, has felt keenly that skepticism ought to be con·
sidered under two relations: as skepticism of criticism and
reform, necessary to correct the presumption of the human
mind and to destroy its prejudices; as skepticism absolute
and determined, which confounds in a common proscrip
tion both truth and error? The first, of which, Socrates
gave the example, and which Bacon and Descartes have
revived‚ is a sort of intellectual remedy that Providence
preparas for healing one of the most fatal maladies of the
human mind, that kind of presumptuous ignorance which
makes one believe that he knows that which he does not
know: the second, which is only the excess and abuse ol
the first, is this same remedy transformed into poison by an

bThe Brahmans call the illusion which results from this veil maye.
According to them, there is only the Suprema Beiug who really and abso-
lutely exista: all the rest is moyn, that is to say, phenomenal, even the trinity
lonned by Brahma, Vishnn, and Rudra.
