undisturbed by the terrible revolutionary storm. In ob
scure seclusion he amasssd, to quote Sedir, “a disconcerting
erudition.'' He became familiar with all the Semitic
tongues and dialects, the Aryan languages, and even pene-

It was during these ten years of retirement that he wrote

sophist, “to give him the name he loved best to hold,’' says
Pierre Leroux in De l‘Humanitb.

Tbeinequality of human conditions, upon which depend

subjects of these esoteric teachings. He has also endeav-
