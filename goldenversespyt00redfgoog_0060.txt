The Essence and Form of Poetry ³7

believe in the very singular accounts which time has pre-
served to us, thanks to the blind real of certain Christians
who have treated them as heresies, this Helen, whose name
applied to the moon signifies the resplendent, this woman
whom Paris carried away from her spouse Menelaus, is
nothing else than the symbol of the human soul,* tom by

forr& hut the acoessory details vary greatly according to the writers who re-
late them. For example, one reads in a small fragment attributed to Antipa-
ter of Sidon and preserved in Greece Anthology, that Homer, born at Thebes
in Egypt, drew his epic subjecte from the archivcs of the temple of Isis; from
another source, Ptolerny Ephesum, cited by Photius, that me Greek poet had
received from a priestof Memphis, named Tlomisss, the original writings cf
an 'urspired damsel, named Phoncy. Strabo, without mentioning any place
in ranicula, said in general, speaking of the long icumeys cf Homer, that
this poet went everywhereto consult the religious archives and the oracles
preserved in the temples3 and Diodorus cf Sicily gives evidence sometimes
that he horrowed many things from a sibyl by the name of Manto, daughter
ol Tiresiam and sometimes that he appropriated the verse of a pythoness of
Delphi, named Daphne All these contradictory details prove, in reality,
the nuth, for whether it be from Thebes, Memphis, Tyre, Delphi, or else-
where that Homer drew the subiect of his chants, matters not with the subject
which occupies me: the important point, serving as proof of my assertione, is,
that they have been, in fact, drawn from a sanctuary; and what has deter-
mined meto chocse Tyre rather than Thebes or Memphis, is thet Tyre was
the first mother city of Graece.

the moon in Greek. The root of this word is alike Celtic and Phoenician.
One finds itinTeutonic hell, which signifies clear, luminous, and in Hebrew ‘hrt
(llll), which contains the same sense of splendour, glory, and elevation. One
still says in German heilig, hely, and relig, blesen: also jola, soul, and rdlm, . ·
scula And thia is worthy cf me closest attention, particularly when one
refloets that, following the doctrine of the ancients, the moon ludent or setene
was regarded as the reservoir of the sculs of those who descend from heaven
to pass into bodies by means of generation, and, purged by the fire cf life,
escape frcm earth to ascend to heaven. See, conceming this doctrine, Plu-
tarch (De Facie in Ort. lua), aad confer with Beausobre (Histoire dra Mantele,
t. ii.. p. 311). 'l’he name of Poris, in Greek Illac, comes from the Phoeni·
cian words ta or *a (bar or plor), all generation, propagation, extension, and
w (isla), the Being-principle.

'l’he name cf flendose, in Greek ueram, comes from the Phoenician
words tn (men), all that which determines, regulatss, cr defines a thing,
pmperly, the rational faulty, the reason, the measure, in Latin mens, mensura·
