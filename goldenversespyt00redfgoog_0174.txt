7. Slill it is given thee to figit ond cvncmne
Thy foousl passione: leam thou to subdue thern.

It seems that Lysis, foreseeing the wrong inductione
that would be drawn from what he had said, and as il he
had a presentiment that one would not fail to generalize the
infiuence oi Necessity upon the actions of men, may have
wished beforehand to oppose himself to the destructive
dogma oi fatality‚ by establishing the empire oi the Will
over the passione. This is in the doctrine of Pythagoras
the real foundation of the liberty of man: for, according to
this philosopher, no one is free, only he who knows how to
master himseli‚⁶ and the yoke of the passione is much
heavier and more difficult ιο throw off than that ol the most
cruel tyrants. Pythagoras, however, did not, according
ιο Hierocles, prescribe destroying the passions, as the Stoice
taught in late tirnes; but only ιο watch over them and repress
excess in thern, because all excess is vicious.d He re·
garded the passions as useiul ιο man, and although produced
in principle by Necessity, and given byanirresistible destiny,
as nevertheless submissive in their use ιο the free power
oi the Will. Plato had well realized this truth and had
forcibly indicated it in many passages ol his works: one
finds it chiefly in the second dialogue oi Hippias, where
this philosopher shows. evidently without seeming ιο have
the design, that man good or bad. virtuous or criminal,
truthiul or false, is only such by the power oi his will, and
that the passion which carries him to virtue or to vice, to
truth or ialsehood, is nothing in itseli; so that no man is
bad, only by the faculty which he has oi being good; nor
good, only by the faculty which he has oi being bad.
