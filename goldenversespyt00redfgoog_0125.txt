102 The Golden Verses ol Pythagoras

tious; asin Madrid it had been chivalrous and gallant.
Everywhere the theatre had to accommodate itseli to the
taste of the people. The first regular tragedy which Pierre
Comeille composed in France was derived from a Spanish
balled. Madrid at that time gave the tone to Europe.
It needed much of the time and all the prosperity of Louis
XIV. to throw off the unseasonable ascendancy that this

without religion, the Caledonians possessed in the heart ol their mountains,
the Gallie Parnassus, the sacred mountain oi the Occidental isles: and that
when the antique cult began to decline in Gaul, it vas in Albion, reclroned

In order to seiae the oceasion oi applying eumolpique lines to a greater

, number of subjecte, Ι arn going to quote a sort oi exposition of Omian, the

only one 1 believe, which is found in his poetas: because Maephemon, ior more
originality, neglected nearly always to annoimce the subject oi his songs.
1 will not give the text, because the English translation whence 1 obtained it
does not give it. It eoncerns the battle ol Lora Altera kind ol exordium
addressed to the son oi the strenger, dweller ol the silent cavero, Ossian said
to him:

Le chent plait-il a ton oreille?

Ecoute le recit du combat de lora.

Il est bien ancien, ce combat! le tumulte

Dee armes, et les cris iurieux des guernere,
Sont couverts par un long silence:
Ils sont eteints depuis longtemps:

Ainsi sur des rochers retentissants, la foudre
Roule, grende, delate et n’est pluer

Le soleil reparalt, et la cime brillante

Des ooteaux verdoyants, soun't h ses rayons.

Son of the secret oell! dost thou delight in songsl

Hear the battle ol lora.

The sound of its steel is long sinoe past.

So thunder on the darkened hill roars, and is no more.

The eun returns with his silent beamu

'Ibe glittering rocks, and green heads oi the mountains smile.

This example serves to prove that eumolpique lines might easily adapt
themselves to the dithyramb.
