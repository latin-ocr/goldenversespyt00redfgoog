230 The Golden Verses os Pythagoras

Ι ciple, and in consequence being neither enlightened nor

virtuous in itsell. The spirit, said Basil, is a giit ol God:
it is the soul of the soul, as it were, it is united to the soul;
it enlightens it, it rescues it from earth and raisos it to ’
heaven· Beausobre, who relates these words, observes
that this sentiment was oommon to several Fathers ol the
primitive church, particularly to Tatian?

Ι have spoken often of this first Ternary, and even ol
the triple iaculties which are attached to each of its modifica-
tions; but as I have done many times, Ι believe it useful
to present here the meothis, so as to have the opportunity
oi uniting, under the same viewpoint, the volitive unity,
from which results the human Quatemary, in general, and
in the particular being, which is man.

The three facultiee which, as I have said, distinguish
each of the three human modificatione are: sense perception
ior the body, sentiment for the soul, and assent ior the spirit.
These three laculties develop instinct, understanding, and
intelligence, which produce by a common reaction, common
sense, reason, and sagacity.

Instinct, placed at the lowest degree of the ontological
hierarchy, is absolutely passive; intelligence, raised to the
summit, is entirely active, and understanding placed in
the centre, is neuter. Sense perception perceives the sensa·
tionS, sentiment conceives the ideas, assent elects the
thoughts; perception, conception, election are modes of
acting, of the instinct, the understanding, and the intelli-
gence. The understanding is the seat ol all the· passions
that the instinct feeds continually, excites, and tends to
make unruly; and that the intelligence purifies temperS,
and seeks always to put in hannony. The instinct, reacted
upon by the understanding, becomes common sense: it
perceives notions more or less clearly, following more or
less, the influence that it accords to the understanding.
