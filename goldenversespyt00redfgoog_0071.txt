48 The Golden verses os Pythagoras

lables‚ had not as yet issued from the sanctuaries: it had
been nearly a thousand years since they had been instituted
by Orpheus* when suddenly one saw for the first time

. certain of these fables and these ceremonies ridiculously

travestied‚ transpin'ng among the people and serving them
for amusement. The fetes of Dionysus celebrated in the
times oi vintage‚ gave place to this sort of profanation.
The grapegatherers, besmeared with lees, giving way in the
intoxicaticn oi wine to an indiscreet enthusiasm, began to
utter aloud from their wagons the allegories that they had
learned in their rural initiations. These allegories, which
neither the actors nor the spectators had comprehended in
reality‚ appeared, nevertheless, piquant to both through the
malieious interpretations which they gave them.¹ Such
were the feeble beginnings ot dramatic art in Greece²; there
was born the profanaticn of the Orphic mysteries, in the
same manner that one sees it rebom among us, by the prola-
nation of the Christian mysteries³ But this art was al-
ready old in Asia when it sprang up in Europe. 1 have
already said that there was in the secret celebration oi the
mysteries, ventable dramatic representations. These mys-
tic ceremonies, copied from those which had taken place
in the celebration ol the Egyptian mysteries had been
brought into Egypt by the Indian priests at a very remote
epoch when the empire ol Hindustan had extended over
this country. This communication, which was made from
one people to another, has been demonstrated to the point
of evidence by the learned researches of the academicians

⁸1 bave placed the epoch oi Orpheus, which coincides with that ci the
arrival ol the Egyptian colony conducted into Groece by Cecrops, nt 1582
nc„ according to the marbles oi Paros.
