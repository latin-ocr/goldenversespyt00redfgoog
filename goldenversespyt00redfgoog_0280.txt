Examinations of the Golden Verses 257

through the medium of several oouncils, that man can do
nothing of himself without the aid of grace. SaintAugustine,
who had been the soul of these oouncils, pressed by the dis·
ciple of Pelagius to explain the nature of this grace and to
say how God accorded it to one man rather than to another

of grace deprived them, not only of virtue in the fleeting
course of this life, but delivered them without hope to the
torments of an eternal hell. But Saint Augustine, who
obeyed a severe and consistent reason, felt very well that he
could not spealr otherwise, without renouncing the dogma of
original sin and overthrowing the foundation of Christianity.
All the rigid Christians, all those who, at different times,
have undertaken to restore Christianity to its constitutive
principles, have thought as Saint Augustine, and although

to orthodoxy, from preaching the same dogma; nor Calvin,
soon after, from adding new lights to what Luther had left
doubtful, and Jansenius, finally, corroborating what Baius
had only outlined, from raising in the very midst of the
