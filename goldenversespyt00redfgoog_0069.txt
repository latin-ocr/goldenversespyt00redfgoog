action gods and men, had opposed heaven and earth, and
depicted the combats of the passions; this art, being joined
to the mannerin which the rhapsodists declaimed his poems²
by alternately relieving one another, and novering themselves
with garments oi different colours adapted to the situation,
had insensibly given rise to drarnatic style and to theatrical
representation.³ This, true in a sense, has need oi a dis-
