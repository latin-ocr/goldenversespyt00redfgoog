168 The Golden Verses of Pythagoras

or upon the future; the necessity of Destiny, upon the things
done, or upon the past: and the one nourished the other
unceasingly, by working upon the materials which they recip
rocally fumished each other; for according to this admirable
philosopher, it is of the past that the future is born, of the
future that the past is formed, and of the union of both that
is engendered the always existing present, from which they
draw alike their origin: a most profound idea that the
Stoics had adopted! Thus, following this doctrine, liberty
rules in the future, necessity in the past, and Providence
over the present. Nothing that exists happens by chance
but by the union of the fundamental and providential law
with the human will which follows or transgresses it, by
operating upon necessity.⁶ The harmony of the Will and
Providence constitutes Good; Evil is born of their opposi-
tion. Man has received three forces adapted to each of the
three modifications of his being, to be guided in the course
that he should pursue on earth and all three enchained to
his Will. The first, attached to the body, is instinct: the
second, devoted to the soul, is virtue; the third, appertaining
to intelligence, is science or wisdom. These three forces,
indifferent in themselves, take this name only through the
good usage that the Will makes of it; for, through bad usage
they degenerate into brutishness, vice, and ignorance. In-
stinct perceives the physical good or evil resulting from
sensation; virtue recognizes the moral good or evil existing
in sentiment; science judges the intelligible good or evil
which springs from assent. In sensation, good or evil is
called pleasure or pain; in sentiment, love or hate, in assent,
truth or error. Sensation, sentiment, and assent, dwelling
in the body, in the soul, and in the spirit, form a ternary,
which becoming developed under favour of a relative unity
constitutes the human quaternary, or Man considered
abstractly. The three affections which compose this ter·
nary act and react upon one another, and become mutually
