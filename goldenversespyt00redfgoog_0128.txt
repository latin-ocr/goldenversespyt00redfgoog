The Essence and Form of Poetry 105

Du bonhenr: viens, o Mose! o toi qui, sur la eime

Se Sinai, d'Oreb, en secret inspiras

La Berger d’Israeh quand d’une voix sacree

Il enseignait comment et la terre et des cieux

Sortirent du Chaos! oo bien, si tu pretereo

Les sommets de Sion, les bords du Siloe,

Qui, pres du Temple saint, roule ses flots, ὀ Mose!

Viens proteget de lo mes chants audacieux,

Mes chants qui, surpassant d'un essor non timide,
’ Les monts Aoniens‚ vont raconter des faits

Que n’ont point encor dits la prose ni la rime.

of Man‘s first disobedienoe‚ and the fruit
of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste
Brought death into the world, and all our woe,
With loss of Eden, till one greater Man
Restore os and regain the blisslul seat,
Sing, heavenly Mose, that, on the secret top
of Oreb oroi Sinai, didst inspire
That shepherd, who first taught the chosen seed,
In the beginning how the heavens and earth
Rose out of chaos; or if Sion hill
Delight thee more. and Siloa's brook that flow’d
Fast by the oracle oi God; 1 thence
, Invoke thy aid to my adventurous song,
That with no middle ssight intends to soar
Above the Aonian mount, while it pursues
Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme.

This invocation is manifestly in imitation of Homer,
from whom Milton has received the second inspiration with-
out the intermediary-Vergil. One can observe in the
English poet the same movement and almost as much
force asin the Greek poet, but much loss clarity‚ precision‚
and particularly harmony. Nearly all of these defects
pertain to his subject and his tongue. Circumstances
were not iavourable to Milton. His lines could not have
been better with the elements that he was forced to employ.
All imperfect as they are, they are worth much more than
those of Klopstock; forat least they are in the character
of his tongue, whereas those of the German poet are not.
