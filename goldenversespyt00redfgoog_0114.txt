The Essence and Form of Poeny ι 91

Can heavenly naturas nourish hate
So fieroe, so blindly passionate?

although very beautiful, contains less depth, less feeling,
and holds less intimately to the subject than this sublime
reflection:

. . . and the men were perishing!

Someone has said that Vergil had imitated in his exposi-
tion the commencement of the Odyssey of Homer; this is
a mistake. One finds always in the exposition of the Odys-
sey the real character ol a first inspiration blended with the

invocation‚ although more calm and less alluring than in the
I h’od. Here is the translation:

Du plus sage Heros, Muse‚ dis les traverses
Sans nombre, apres qu‘il eut triomphe d’Ilion:
Rapelle les cites, les peuples‚ les usages
Qu'il connut, et les mers oh longtemps il erra:

A quels soins devorante, a quels maux l’exposerent
L'amour de la patrie et noble desir

D'y mener ses guerriers! Vain desir: ils oserent,
Insenses! du Soleil devorer les troupeaux;

Et ce Dieu‚ du retour leur ravit la journee.
Pais-nous part de ces faits, fille de Jupiter.

Tell me, Ο Muse‚ ol that sagacions man
Wh0, having overthrown the sacred town

Of Ilium, wandered far and visited

The capitals of many natione learned

The customs ol their dwellers and endured
Great suffering on the deep; his life was oft
In peril, as he laboured to bring back

His comrades to their homes. He saved thern not,
Though earnestly he strove; they perished all,
Throngh their own folly; lor they banqueted‚
Madmenl upon the oxen of the Suu,-

The all-o’erlooking Sun, who cut them off
From their return. 0 Goddess. virgin-child

of Jove, relate some part of this to me. B
avim.
