The Essence and Form of Poetry 83

anything could, however, make one doubt that rhyme may
be natural to Europe, it is that ancient Scandinavian, in
which are written the precious fragments which have come
down to us ccnceming the mythological cultos the Celts,
our ancestors, does not rhyme; also it rises often to the
sublimity of Eumolpoeia.¹ This observation, which makes
us reject Arabia, will take us back to India, if we consider
that there is plausible presumption in believing that the
Phoenicians and the Egyptians who had sc much intercourse
with the Arabs, did not rhyme, since the sacred book of
the Hebrews, the Sepher, that we call the Bible, and which

appears to have issued from the Egyptian sanctuaries, is
written in cadenced rhyme, as the Zona-Acesta of the Parsees
and the Vedcs of the Indians.²

The outline thatIhave just sketched confirms, Messieurs,
what 1 have wished to prove to you and which is the sub·
ject of this discourse, the distinction that should be made
between the essence and the form of poetry, and the re-
ciproear influence that should be recognized between these
two parts of the science. You have seen that wherever
rhyme has dominated exclusively‚ as in Asia among the

entire translation.

² It was said long ago that a great number cf rhymed verses were found in
the Bible, and Voltaire even has cited a ridiculcus example iu his Dictionnairr
philosophique (art. Riun): but it seems to me that before concaming cneself
so much as one still does, whether the Hebraic text of the Seplm is in prose or
in verae, whether or not one finds there rhymed verses after the manner cf
the Arabs, or measured after the manner of the Greeks, it 'would be well to
obeerve whether one understands this text. The language of Moses has been
lost entirely for more than two thousand four hundred years, and unless it
be restored withfan aptitude,'force,'and coustancy which is nowadays musual.
Idoubt whether it will be known exactly what the legislator of the Hebrews
bar said regarding the principles of the Universa, the origin of the earth, and
the birth and vicissitudes of the beings who people it. These subjecte are,
however, worth the pains ifone would reflect upon them; I cannot prevent
myself from thinking that it would be more fitting tc be occupied with the
meaning cf the words, than their arrangements by long and short syllables,
by regular or alternate rhymes, which is of no importanoe whatever.
