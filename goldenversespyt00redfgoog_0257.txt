²34 The Golden Verses of Pytlragoras

How could Epicurus say suchathing before having explained
clearly and without amphibology, what the origin of good
andevilis,soastoprove that the godsindeed dcnotco
operate either sor the augmentation of the one, or the
diminution· of the other? But Epicurus had never dreamed
of giving this explanation. However little he might have
considered it, he would have seen that in whatever fashion
he had given it, it would have overthrown the doctrine of
atoms; sor a sole principle, whatever it may be, cannot
produce at the same time good and evil. Nevertheless,
if he has not explained this origin, and if he has not shown
in a peremptory way that we are in a sphere where absolute
evil reigns, and that consequently we can have no sort of
communicaticn with that wherein good resides, it will re-
main always evident that if we are not in such a sphere,
and if we possess a portion cf good, this good must come to
us from the sphere wherein absolute good has its source.
Now, this sphere is precisely that in which Epicurus places
the gods.⁰ But, perhaps, a defender of Epicurus will
say, the good that we possess comes to us only once from
the divina sphere and thenceforth it comes to us nc more.
This is contrary to the most intimate and most general
notion that we have of the Divinity, to that cf its immutabil-
ity upon which Epicurus himself leans most, and from which
it results that the gods could never be what they have
been, nor do what they have done.

In one word, just as well as in a thousand, any makes of
a system is obliged to do one of two things, either to declare
himself what the origin is of good and evil, or to admit
u priori the theosophical dogma of the liberty of man. Epi-
curus knew this, and although this dogma might ruin his
system completely, he preferred to admit it than expose
himself to give an explanation beyond his capability and
beyond that of all men. But if man is free, he can be coun-
selled; if he can be counselled, it is evident that he can,
