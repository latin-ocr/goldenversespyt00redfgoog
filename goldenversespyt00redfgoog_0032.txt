The Essence and Form oi Poetry 9

more heroic. All must be increased and embellished by its
voice and receive irom it a new existence; it is necessary even
that virtue shine with an relat more pure; that the veil which
covers truth be liited from its eyes and that the course of Pro-
videnoe, better discerned, be allowed to penetrate into the most
secret causes of events.

The philosopher who expressed thus his thought regard-
ing the essenoe of poetry, was far from believing, as the vul·

of poetry, the positive form might be the only genuine;
that is to say, that they do not by any means consider that
the human characters put upon the stage by the poets
whom I have just named, were historic characters. Bacon
understood well that Achilles, Agamemnon, Ulysses, Castor
and Pollux, Helen, Iphigenia, OEdipus, Phaedra, etc„ are
somewhat more than they appear to be, and that their
virtues or their vices, their heroic actions, even their crimes,
celebrated by poetry, contain a profound meaning wherein
lie buried the mysteriec of religion and the secrets of

far as its msenoe, to imagine that a small city of Asia, un·
known to all Asia, around which the King of kings of Graece
waited in vain for ten years to avenge the honour of his
brother betrayed by his wile, should be able during three
thousand years to occupy the greatest minds of Europe,
on account of a quarrel which was raised in the tenth year
of the siege, between this King of kings and a petty prince
of his army, angry and sullry, named Achilles. It is only
