The Essence and Form oi Poetry 31

that of the prophets, the miuisters oi the altars, the precep-
tors and the legislators of the world. I rejoioe to repeat
this truth, aiter rendering homage to Orpheus, to this
admirable man, to whom Europe owes the 16161 with which
she has shone and with which she will shine a long time.
Orpheus has been the real creaturos poetry and oi music,¹
the iather oi mythology, oi morals, and of philosophy: it is
he who has served as model ior Hesiod and Homer, who has
illumined the footsteps oi Pythagoras and Plat0.

After having wisely accommodated the outward oere-
monies to the minds oi the people whom he wished to in·
struet, Orpheus divided his doctrine into two parts, the one
vulgar, and the other mysterious and secret, following in
this the method of the Egyptians, whose disciple he had
been²; then, turning his attention to poetry, and seeing
into what chaos this science had fallen and the confusion
that had been made oi divine and profane things, he judi-

assigned, the one to theology, the other to natural philo-

oi subjecte. Tirne has destroyed nearly all oi them; but
their memory has been perpetuated. Among the works
oi Orpheus that were cited by the ancients and whose loss
must be deplored, were found, ou the subject of theosophy,
116 Holy ,Word or The Socred Logos,* by which Pythagoras
and Plato profited much; the Τ heogony, which preceded that
of Hesiod more than five centuries; 116 Initriitrbns 16 116
Mysteries os 116 Morta os 116 Gods,** and The Riluol os 116
Somfices, wherein he had recorded, undoubtedly, the divers
parts oi his doctrine³1 ou the subject of philosophy, a cele-
