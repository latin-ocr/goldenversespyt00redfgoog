sufferings.· Such were those among the Christiana of the
fifth century, who were named Predestinarians on account
of their terrible system. Their opinion, it is true, was con-
demned by the oouncils of Arles and Lyon'; but they
declared that the church fell into inconsistency, sinoe the
sentiment in this respect, being exactly conformable with
that which Saint Augustine had advanoed against the Pela·

proved it later on, by causing in this church, at different
times, troubles more or less violent on the subject.

This is the moment to complete the proofs of what I

demonstrated as a decisive point in this matter that those
of his followers who rejected the oral tradition of this great

man, to attach themselves to the literal meaning only of his
Sepher, fell into fatalism and were led to make God himself
the author of Evil; finally I have announced that Chris-
