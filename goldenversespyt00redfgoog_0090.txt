The Essence and Form ol Poetry 67

become prudent, assumed the part of silence by retin‘ng
into monasteries or hermitages, studying Nature there in
quietude, and profiting alone by their discoveries. If certain
ones still dared to speak, it was by borrowing the style of
religion, or history, diverting from the ordinary sense certain
ideas received, explaining themselves by enigmas, or by
figures which, when necessary, they were able to explain

Among this number was a man of strong imagination

and such was the ignorance not only of the people, but even

of the clergy, that the most palpable fictions were taken for

the couneil of Rheims, celebrated in 1119, declared this
work authentic³; and thence came the habit of attributing
it to Archbishop Turpin. However that may be, it is to
the allegorical history of Charlemagne, to that ol his twelve
paladins called peers of France, to that of the four sons of
Aymon and of Chevalier Bayard, to that of Renaud, Roland,
Richard, and the other heroes of the bibliotheque ὀίεαι, for
