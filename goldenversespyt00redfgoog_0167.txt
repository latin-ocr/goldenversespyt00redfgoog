144 The Golden Verses ol Pythagoras

there that the greatest crime is to lack in filial piety, he
infers that he who has been a good son will be a good father
and that thus nothing will breair the social ·tie“; for he
first establishes this virtue which embraces all, from the
emperor to the lowliest of his subjects, and that it is for the
peoples what the regularity of the celestial movements is
for the ethereal space: but in Italy and in Greece where
Pythagoras established his dogmas, it would have been
dangerous for him to give the same extension, since this
virtue not being that of the State, would necessarily involve

certain peoples. That is the reason the disciples of this
philosopher, in distinguishing between forced and voluntary
actions, judged wisely that it would be necessary to apply
here the distinction: therefore they urged to honour one’s
father and mother and to obey them in all that concems
the body and mundane things, but without abandoning
one's soul to them⁶; for the divine law declares free what
has not been received from them and delivers it from

the Great, felt so keenly and expressed so felicitously
by the following: “My friend is another myself.”l lt is
