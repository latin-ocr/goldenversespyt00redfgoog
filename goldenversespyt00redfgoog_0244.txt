Examinations of the Golden Verses 221

Goddess was removed. This manifestation, called Epi-
phany, shed the most brilliant light upon the darkness which
until then had surrounded the initiate. It was prepared,
said the historiam, by frightful tableaux with alternatives
of both terror and hope.⁶ 'Ibe grade of Elect has replaoed
that of Epopt among the Free Masons, without in any sense
offering the same results. The forms are indeed nearly
preserved; but the substance has disappeared. The Epopt
of Eleusis, Samothraoe, or Hierapolis was regarded as the
foremost of men, the favourite of the gods, and the possessor
of oelestial treasures; the sun shone, in his sight, with a
purer brightness; and the sublime virtue that he had ac·
quired in the tests, more and more difficolt, and the lessons
more and more lofty, gave him the facrdty of disoerning
good and evil, truth and error, and of making a free choioe
between them!

But if the various grades of initiation expressed symboli-
cally the different degrees of virtue to which men in general
can attain, the tests that one was made to pass through at
each new grade, made known in particular, whether the
man who presented himself to obtain it, was worthy or
unworthy. These tests were at first sufficiently easy; but
they became increasingly difficult to such an extent that
the life of the new member was frequently in danger. One
would know in that way to what sort of man this life be-
longed, and verify by the crucible of terror and of suffering,
the temper of the soul and the claim of his right to the truth.
It is known that Pythagoras owed to his extreme patience
and to the courage with which he surmounted all the
obstacles, his initiation into the Egyptian mysteries.

Those who attained as he did the last degree of initiation

were very rare; the greater number went no further than
the second grade and very few attained the third. Iessons
