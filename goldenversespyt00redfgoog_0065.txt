4² The Golden Verses ol Pythagoras

one can judge by the energetic manner with which he at-
tacked that which he found in use. The Greek language,
which preserved still in his time something ol the Phoeni·
cian stiffness and the Celtic roughness, obliged to adapt
itself to all the movements of his imagination, became the
most flexible and the most harmonicus dialect of the earth.
One is astonished, in reading his works, at the boldness of
his composition.¹ One sees him without the least effort,
bending words at his pleasure, lengthening thern, shortening
them to produce something nov, reviving those no longer
in use, uniting them, separating them, disposing of thern in
an unaccustomed order, forcing them to adapt themselves
everywhere to the harmony that he wishes to depict, to
sentiments of elevation, of pleasure or terror, that he
wishes to inspire.

Thus genius, dominating form, creates master-picces;
form, on the contrary, commanding geniuS, produces only
works ol the mind. Ι must say finally and no longer veil
from the attention ol my judges, the aim ol this discourse:
whenever rhyme exists in the poetic form, it renders the
form inflexible, it brings upon it only the effort ol talent
and renders that of intellectual inspiration useless. Never
will the people who rhyme their verses attain to the height
of poetic perlection, never will real epopoeia floun'sh in their
breasts. They will hear neither the accents inspired by
Orpheus, nor the stirring and impassioned harmonies of
Homer. Far from drawing the allegorical genius at its
source and receiving the first inspiration, it will not even
recognize the second one. Its poets will polish painfully
certain impassioned or descriptive verses, and will call
beautiful the works which will only be well done. A rapid
glance over the poetic condition of the earth will prove what
I have advanced. But l ought to explain beforehand what
