particular system which still bears this name. Leucippus,
Democritus, and Epicurus adopted it, adding to it their own
ideas; and Lucretius having naturalized it among the Ro·
mans, favoured its passage down to these modern times
when the greater part of our philosophers have done nothing
but renovate it under other forms.⁴¹ Assuredly there is
no system whence the fatal necessity of all things issues more
inevitably than from that of atoms; also it is certain that
Democritus was accused of admitting a compulsory destiny, ⁶

atoms as absolutely inanimate,d rejected it nevenheless,
and not wishing to admit a dogma subversive of all morals,
he declared himself against it, and taught the liberty of
man!

A singular thing is, that this fatality which appears at·

Divine Providence! followed still more naturally from
the opposed system, wherein the spiritualist philosophcrs

are affected. Parmenides, Melissus and Zeno oi Elea, who
adopted it, sustained it with great success: they asserted
that matter was only pure illusion, that there is nothing in
things, that bodies and all their variations are only pure
