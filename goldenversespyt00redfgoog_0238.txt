to know,‘ and to engage him, through the need oi his own
felicity, to follow the paths ol virtue, and to admit the
system of recompense which proceeds from the existence ol
God and the immortality ol the soul. Thus, this common
sense, already invoked to aid the existence oi the physical
subjects which Berkeley reduoed to nothingness, was called,
under another name, to sustain that ol the spiritual beings
