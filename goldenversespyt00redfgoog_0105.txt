82 The Golden Verses ol Pythagoras

Persian poet Firdausi appears to have followed similar
tr'aditions conseming the ancient kings oi Iran, in his famous
poem entitled slah-Nonum The wonders which reign
in these traditions have been transmitted no doubt by the

· Arabs, with the artifice of rhyme: both have the same spirit.

The protecting lairies ol the knights, the giant persecutors
ol ludier, the enchanters, the magio, and all those illusions
are the imits of that brilliant and dreamy imagination which
characterizes the modern Orientals. We have enthusiasti-
cally enjoyed them in the depths ol the barbarity where we
were plunged; we have allowed ourselves to be drawn by
the charms ol rhyme, like children in the cradle whom their
nurses put to slcep by the monotonous sound oi a lullaby.
Escapod from that state of languor, and struck at last with
a gleam ol real intelligence, we have compared Greece and
Arabia, the songs of epopoeia and those ol the ballads; we
have blushed at our choioe3 we have wished to change it;
but owing to the captivating form always more or less the
substance, we have only sucoeeded in making mixturas
more or less happy, acoording to the secondary mode that
we follow. -

Rhyme, brought into Europe by the Arabs more than
a thousand years ago, spread by degrees among all nations‚
in such a way that when one wishes to examine its origin
with accuracy, one no longer knows whether it is indigenous
there or exotic. One finds on all sides only rhymed verses.
The Spanish, Portuguese, Italiam, French, Germans oi all
dialects, Hollanders‚ Danes, Swedes and Norwegians, all
rhyme.² The modern Greeks themselves have forgotten
their ancient rhythm in order to assume our style.³ If
