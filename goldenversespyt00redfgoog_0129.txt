106 The Golden Verses os Pythagoras

Milton is satisfied with throwing off the yoke of rhyme, and
has made eumolpique lines of one foot only, measured by
ten syllables. Their defect, inherent in the English idiom,
consists, as I have said, in having all the lines bearing equally
the masculine final, J'arring continually one with the other.
Klopstock has aspired to make, in German, verses measured
by the musical rhythm of the Greeks; buthe has not per-
ceived that he took as long and short, in his tongue, syllables
which were not such in musical rhythm, but by accent and
prosody, which is quite different. The German tongue,
composed of contracted words and consequently bn‘stling
with consonants, bears no resemblance to the Greek, whose
words, abounding in vowels‚ were, on the contrary, made
clear by their elongation. The rhythmic lines of Klop-
stock are materially a third longer than those of Homer,
although the German poet has aspired to build them on an
equal measure.¹ Their rhythmic harmony, if it exists
there, is absolutely factitious; it is a pedantic imitation and
nothing more. In order to make the movement of these
lines understood in French, and to copy as closely as possible
their harmony, it is necessary to compose lines of two
casuras, or what amounts to the same, to employ constantly
a line and a half to represent a single one. Here are the
first fourteen lines which contain the exposition and invoca-
tion of the Messiah:

Des coupables humains, celebre, Arne immortalia,
l’heureuse delivrance,

Que sur terre envoye le Messie accomplit
dans son humanite:

Dis comment il rendit les fils du premier homme
h leur Auteur celeste;

¹ In comparing the first lines oi Homer with those of Klopstock, it is seen
that the Greek contains 29 letters, 18 ol which are vowels; and the German
48 letters, 31 oi which are consonante. Itis difficolt with such disparity in
tha elernents to make the harmony the same.
