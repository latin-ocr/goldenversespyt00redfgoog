TRANSLATOR'S FOREWORD

N this tweutieth century, the sacred books of the an·
cients are undoubtedly better understood than they were
even by their oontemporaries, ior their authors, by the
greatness oi their genius, are as much nearer to us, as they
were distant from them. At the close oi the eighteenth
oentury, the light which oame from the illimitable mind oi
Fabre d’Olivet shone with solitary splendour end was des·
tined to be seen by only a few devoted followers. But

’ history shows theta great inspirer always appears at the

beginning oi every great epoch‚ and however srnall the num-
ber of his disciplos, these disciplos with their pupils form
the magnetic chain which, according to Plato, carries his
thought out into the world.

Fabre d'Olivet‚ born at Ganges, BasLanguedoc, Dec. 8,
1768, was distinguished even in his own day not only ior
the extent oi his learning but ior the rectitude oi his judg·
ment and the sublimity of his oonceptions. If one can infer
from the all too soarce reoords available sinoe the calamitous
fire which destroyed so many oi his valued manuscripts, he
evidently suffered keenly from the letters oi mortality‚ and

sought with uniailing iervour what Porphyry so aptly oelled
the “Olympia of the Soul.''

Saint Yves d’Alveydre, writing of him in Lo Franco moth,
says, that it was in 1790, while in Germany, he received
his Pythagorean initiation, the profound imprint oi which
marked all his later productions. After returning to Paris
he applied himself to philological and philosophical studies
