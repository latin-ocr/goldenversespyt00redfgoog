22 The Golden Verses of Pythagoras

allegorioal fables which remain to us on this subject de-
pict, more particularly than they have done with any
other, the course of his thoughts and the success of his
institutione.

Orpheus belongs, on the one side, to anterior times, and
on the other, to times merely ancient. The epoch when he
appeared is the line of demarcation between pure allegory
and mixed allegory, the intelligible and the sentient. He
taught how to ally the rational faculty with the imagina-
, tive faculty. The science which was along time after
,. called philosophy, originated with him. He laid its first
basis.

One should guard against believing, following in the
footsteps of certain historiens deoeived by the meaning of
allegorical fables, that when Orpheus appeared, Graece,
still barbarous, offered only the traces of a civilization hardly
outlined, or that the ferocious animals, tamed by the charm
of his poetry, should represent, in effect, the inhabitants of
this beautiful country. Men capable of receiving a cult
so brilliant as that of Orpheus, a doctrine so pure, and
mysteries so profound; men who possessed a language so
formed, so noble, so harmonious as that which served that
inspired man to compose his hymns, were far from being
ignorant and savage to this degree. It is not true, as has
been said and repeated without examination, that poetry
had its birth in the forests, in regions rough and wild, nor
above all, that it may be the concomitant of the infancy
of the nations and the first stammerings of the human mind.
Poetry, on the contrary, having attained its perfection, indi·
cates always along existence among the peoples, a civiliza-
tion very advanced and all the splendour of a virile age.
The sanctuary of the temple is its true cradle. Glance
over the savage world and see if the Iroquois or the Samoyeds
have a poetry. Have the peoples who were found in their
infancy in the isles of the Pacific shown you hymns like
those of Orpheus, epic monuments like the poems of Homer?
