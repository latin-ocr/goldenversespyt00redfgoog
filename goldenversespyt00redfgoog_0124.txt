The Essence and Form of Poetry 101

Like AEschylus he conducted one to virtue by terror; but
unfortunately the taste of the spectatore, upon which he
was forced to model his, led him to degrade his tableeux
by grotesque figures: the English people were not sufficiently
advanced to comprehend the moral end of the tragedy.
They must be amused; and Shakespeare succeeded only at
the expense of the beauties of the art. Historic facts and
trivial soenes replaced the mysterious and sublime subjects.

In London‚ the dramatic muse was turbulent and licen-

“In the beginning, when naught was, there
Was neither sand nor sea nor the oold waves,
Nor was earth ιο be seen nor heaven above.
'lbere wasa Yawning Chasm [cbaos] but grass nowhere. . . . ”

As ιο the Gallie poetry oi the Scotch bards, that Maepherson has made
known to us 'under the name oi Ossion, much is needed that they may bave a
sufficient degree oi authenticity for them to be cited as models, and placed

dours, must be restored and often entirely remade, ii they are ιο be read.
Maepherson, in composing his Ossion, has followed certain ancient traditions,
has put together certain scattered fragments; but has taken great liberties
with all the rest. He was, besides, a man endowed with creative genius and
he might bave been able ιο attain to epopoeia if he had been better informed.
His lack oi knowledge has leit a void in his work which demonstratas its
lalsity. There is no mythology, no allegory, no cult in Ossion. There are
some historic or romanosque facts joined to long descriptions; it is a style
more emphatic than figurative, more biaarre than original. Maepherson,
in neglecting all kinds of mythological and religious ideas, in even mocldng
here and there the stone of power oi the Scandinavians, has shown that he
was ignorant of two important things: the one, that the allegorical or religious
genius constitutas the essenos of poetry; the other, that Sootland was at a
