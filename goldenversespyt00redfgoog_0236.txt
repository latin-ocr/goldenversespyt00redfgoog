inferenoe. Its nature is to go straight; its perlection is
nothing else. One goes straight in every way, in every
direction, high, low, to right, to left; one reasons correctly
in truth as in error, in vice as in virtue: all depends upon
the principle from which one sets out, and upon the manner
in which one looks at things. Reason does not give this
principle, it is no more master of the end which it goes to
attain, than the straight line drawn upon the ground is
master of the point toward which it tends. This end and
this point are determined beforehand, by the position ol the
reasoner or by geometry.

Reason exists alikeinthe three great human modificatione,
,although its principal seat is in the soul, according to Plato.⁸

piece ol game without touching it, he obeys an instinctive
reason which makes him sacrifice the pleasure ol gratiiying
his appetite, to the pain of receiving the blow ol a stick.
When a man dies at his post instead of abandoning it, he
follows a moral reason which makes him prefer the glory ol
dying to the shame of living. When a philosopher admits
the immortality ol the soul, he listens to an intellectual
reason which shows him the impossibility of its annihilation.
All this, nevenhelem, talres place only sofar as the dog, the
man, and the philosopher admit the roal principles; foril
they admitted false principles, their reasons, although
equally well deduced, would oonductthem to opposed re·
sults; and the piace ol game would be caten, the post
would be abandoned, and the immortality ol the soul
would be denied.

One ought to feel now the mistake of Kant in all its

extent. This philosopher having confounded one of the
