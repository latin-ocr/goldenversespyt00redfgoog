In many of my preceding Examinations Ι have already
explained what should be understood by this celebrated
Tetrad, and here would perhaps be the time to reveal its
constitutive principles3 but this revelation would lead me

into details of the arithmological doctrine of Pythagoras
which, lacking preliminary data, would become fatiguing
and unintelligible. The language of Numbers of which
this philosopher made use, following the example of the
ancient sages, seems today entirely lost. The fragments
which have come down to us serve rather to prove its exist·
enee than to give any light upon its elements; for those
who have composed these fragments wrote in a language
that they supposed understood, in the same manner as our
modern writers when they employ algebraic terms. It would
be ridiculous if one wished before having aoquired any
noticn concerning the value and use of the algebraic signs,
to explain a problem contained in these signs. This is,
however, what has often been done relative to the language
of Numbers. One has pretended, not only to explain it
before having learned it, but even to write cf it, and has
by so doing rendered it the most lamentable thing in the
world. The savants seeing it thus travestied have justly
scorned it; as their contempt was nct unreasonable they
have made it reticet, by the same language upon the ancients
who have employed it. They have acted in this as in many
other things; they themselves creating the stupidity of
ancient sciences and saying afterwards: antiquity was stupid.

One day 1 shall try, if Ι find the time and the necessary
facilities‚ to give the true elements of the arithmolcgical
science of Pythagoras and Ι will show that this science was

for physica] things; but I shall only do so after having re
