60 The Golden Verses of Pythagoras

admirers. Vergil, strongly attracted by the magnetic
flame of Homer, dared to tread in his light, overthrow all
the obstacles that time had raised, and drawing near to
this divine model, received from him the second inspiration

emanation of the Divinity, so much had they fled from it
since they had corne to see in it only the vain production of

somewhat new, with which Ι may engage your attention:
the first comedies appeared five hundred and eighty years
before our era, which was about twenty years after Phere-

doubtless, did not believe that a language prostituted to the
burlesque parodies of Susarion should be useiul further to
the meditations of the sagos. Itis not, however, that at
long intervals certain philosophers such as Empedocles,
Parmenides, and many others of their disciples, have not
