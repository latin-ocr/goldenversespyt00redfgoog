Examinations of the Golden Verses ²41

spect, he added only, that prayer exacted much precaution
and prudenoe, lest, without perceiving it, one demand of
God great evils, in thinking to ask great blessings.

The sage [he said] knows what he ought to say or do; the
fool is ignorant of it; the one implores in prayer, what can be
really useful to him; the other desires often things which, being
granted him, become for him the source of greatest misfortunes.
The prudent man [he addsl, however little he may doubt himself,
ought to resign himself to Providence who knows better than he,
the consequences that things must have. ’

This is why Socrates cited as a model of sense and reason
this prayer of an ancient poet:

Grant us good whether prayed for or unsought by us;
But that which we ask amiss, do thou averte

The prayer was, as 1 have said, one of the principal
dogmas of the religion of Zoroaster ⁶: the Persians also
had the greatest confidence therein. Like the Chaldeans,
they founded all magical power upon its efficacy. They
still possess today certain kinds of prayers for conjtuing
maladies and driving away demons. These prayers, which
they name tovids, are written upon strips of paper and car-
ried after the manner of talismans.⁶ It is quite well·
known that the modern Jews use them in the same way.
In this they imitate, as in innumerable other things, the
' ancient Egyptians whose secret doctrine Moses has trans-
mitted to them! The early Christians were inclined to
theosophical ideas on this subject. Origen explains it

Soit que je pense ou non a vous le demanda,
Et si demes desire l'objet m’etait contraire,
