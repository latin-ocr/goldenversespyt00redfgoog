84 The Golden Verses ol Pythagoras

Chinese, Arabiane, Persians; as in Europe among all the
modern peoples, it has excluded epopoeia and has replaced
allegorical genius by the spirit ο1 romantic fictions; you
have seen that wherever eumolpique poetry has wished to
appear, whether moral or rational, theosophical or philo·
sophical, it hasbeen obliged to have recourse to a particular
prose, when the form oi poetry has resisted it, as has hap·
pened in China for the KingS, in Persia for the Zered-Anasta,

aiter it the frivolous jingling of Arabic sounds, it cannot
even succeed to the partia] domination ο1 Greek or Latin?
Must it be necessary then that it betray its high destinies,
and that the providential decree which founds the European
empire, exempt it from the glory which it promises to the
French name?

Ihave told you, Messieurs, in beginning this discourse,
that it was in the interest oi science alone that I entered
