thioal forms, much in common with our modern operas;
tut what eminently distinguished it is that, having come
forth complete from the depths of the sanctuaria, it pos·
med a moral sense which the initietes understood. This
iswhat put it above anything that we might be able to
unoeive today; what gave it an inestimable price. Where-
as the vulgar, dauzled only by the pomp oi the spectacle,
alned by the beauty of the verse and the music, enjoyed
merely a fleeting gratification, the wise tasted a pleasure
more pure and more durable, by receiving the truth in their
beans even from the deceitful delusions of the senses. This
pleasure was as much greater as the inspiration of the poet
had been more perfect, and as he had succeeded better in
making the allegorieal spirit felt, without betraying the veil
which covered it.

AEschylus went further in comprehension of the subject
than any of his sucoessors. His plans were of an extreme
dmplicity. He deviated little from the mythological tradi·
ιίοιι.1 All his efforts tended only to give light to their
toeehings to penetrate into their hidden beauties. The
characters of his heroes, strongly drawn, sustained them
at heights where Homer had placed them. He caused
terror to pass before them that they might be frightened.³
His aim was to lead them to virtue by terror, and to inspire
the soul with a force capable of resisting alike the intoxica-
tions oi prosperity and the discouragements of poverty.
