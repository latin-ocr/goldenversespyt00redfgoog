Examinations os the Golden Verses 139

part. Through the first, man became purified of his un·
cleanness, emerged from the darkness of ignoranoe, and
attained to virtue: through the second, he used his acquired
virtue to become united to the Divinity through whose
means he arrived at perlection. These two parts are found
quite distinct in the Golden Verses. Hierocles, who has
clearly grasped them, speaks of it in the beginning of his
Commentarios and designatas thern by two words which
contain, he said, all the doctrine of Pythagoras, Punficalrbn
and Persarum! The Magians and the Chaldeans, all
ol whose principles Pythagoras had adopted, were agreed
on this point, and in order to express their idea, made use
ol a parabolical phrase very celebrated among them. “We
consume‚’' they said, “the reiuse of matter by the fire ol
divine love.’'⁶ An anonymous author who has written an
history of Pythagoras, preserved by Photius‚ said that the
disciples of this great man taught that one perlects oneself
in three ways: in communing with the gods, in doing good
in imitation ol the gods, and in departing from this lile to
rejoin the gods‘ The first of these ways is contained in
the first three lines ol the Golden Verses which concern the
cult rendered, according to the law and according to the
saith, to the Gods, to the glorified Heroes, and to the Spirits.
The second, that is, the Purification‚ begins at the fourth
line which makes the subject of this Examination. The

third, that is, the union with the Divinity, or Perfection, ¹

begins at the fortieth lincol my translation:

Let not sleep e'er close thy tired eyes.

Thus the division that I have believed ought to be made

of this short poem is not at all arbitrary, as one sees the
judicious Bayle had remarked it before me'.d
