12 The Golden Verses ol Pythagoras

in the intellectual nature, is manifested in action by passing
into the elementary nature by means of the inner lebour of
the poet who invests it with a sentient form according to ·
his talent; you perceive finally, how, following this simple
theory, Ι explain the words of Plato, and how Ι conceive
that the inspired poet transmits to men the ideas of the gods.
Ι have no noed Ι think of telling you that Ι make an enor-
mous difference between this divine inspiration which exalts
the soul and fills it with a real enthusiasm, and that sort
of inner movement or disorder which the vulgar also call
inspiration, which in its greatest perfection is only passion ex·
cited by the love of glory, united withahabit ol verse making,
which constitutos the talent, and in its imperfectiori is only
a disordered passion called by Boileau, an ardour lor rhym·
ing. These two kinds of inspiration in no wise resemble
each other; their effects are as different as their causes,
their productions as different as their sources. The one,
issuing lrom the intellectual nature, has its immutability:
it is the same in all time, among all peoples, and in the heart
of all men who receive it; it alone produces genius: its first
. manifestation is very rare, but its second manifestation is
less so, as Ι will show later on. The other inspiration, in·
herent in sentient nature, born of passion, varies with the
whim of men and things, and takes on the hue of the customs
and the times; it can bring forth talent or at least modify
it, and when it is seconded by a great facility, can go tothe
extent of leigning genius but never farther: its real domain
is the mind. Its possession is not very rare even in its
perlection. One can sometimes find it united with the true
inspiration, first asin Homer, or second as in Vergil; and
then the form which it unocasingly works over, joining its
sentient beauties to the intellectual beauties of genius,
creates the monuments of seience.

It may be that the development which I have just given
of my ideas on the essenoe of poetry will appear new, al·
though Ι must acknowledge that in reality they are not.
