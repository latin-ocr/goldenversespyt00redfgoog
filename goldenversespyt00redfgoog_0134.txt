The Essence and Form of Poetry 111

talent alone will aspire to this in vain. Epopoeia will only
be the portion of the one who thoroughly understands the
essence of poetry and who is able to apply to it a proper
form. I have penetrated this essence as far as has been
possible for me, and I have revealed my ideas, Messieurs,
as clearly as the insufficiency of my means has permitted.
I trust that their development may have appeared satis·
factory and useful to you; I trust equally that the new form
which I offer you men'ts your attention. I have applied
it before you, to ideas, to intentioris and to very different
harmonias: it adapts itself here, for of itseli it is nothing.
Subject wholly to poetic essonae, it receives therefrom all its
lustre. If the ideas that it would render have grandem and
sublimity, it will easily become grand and sublime; but
nothing would be poorer and more void, than that it should
serve trivial thoughts or that it should conceal an absolute
want of ideas. Do not imagine, Massicum, that the ab·
sence of rhyme makes easy the French verse; it is precisely
this absence which makes the great difficulty: for there is
not then the means of writing without thinking. One can,
with the aid of talent and practice, compose pleasing rhymed
verse, without a great expenditure of ideas; the enormous
quantity that is made today proves that it is not very
difficolt. The elegance of form supplies the sterility ol
substance. But this form becomes at last worn out; the
rhymes are not inexhaustible; one word attracts another,
forces it to unite with it, making understood the sounds
that one has heard a thousand times, repeating the pictures
which are everywhere: one repeats unceasingly the same
things: the enjambment which gives so much grace to the
Greek and Latin verse and without which real epic impulse
cannot exist, is opposed to the rhyme and destroys it. You
can see, Massicum, that it constitutes one of the principal
qualities of eumolpique verse; nothing here oonstrains the
enthusiasm of the poet.
