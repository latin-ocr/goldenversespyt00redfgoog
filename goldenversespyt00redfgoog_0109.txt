86 The Golden Verses of Pythagoras

Femiuine, as in:

Rome qui t’a vu naltre et que ton coeur adore!
Rome enfin que je hais parce qu’elle t’honore!

In rhymed verses, such as these I have just cited, two
feet of the same kind are obliged to follow one another on
account of the rhyme which links them; they then form but
one whole and, proceeding abreast without being separated,
they injure by their forced mass the rapidity of expression
and ssight of thought. If a third foot of the same kind
occur with the other two feet, rhyming together, it would
have to rhyme with them to prevent an insupportable dis-
oordance, which is not tolerated;afourth orafifth foot would
submit to the same law, so that, if the poet wished to fill
his piece with masculine verses alone, it would be necessary
that he should make them proceed upon a single rhyme, as
the Arabs do today and as our early troubadours did,
following their example. The French poet can vary his
rhyme only by varying the style of his verses and by min-
gling alternately together the masculine and feminine finals.

As these two kinds of finals are dissimilar without being
opposed, they may be brought together without the need
of rhyming; their meeting, far from being disagreeable is,
on the contrary, only pleasing; two finals of the same kind,
whether masculine or feminine, can never clash without
causing the same sound-rhat is, without rhyming; but it is
not thus with the finals of different kinds, since the rhyme is
impossible in this case. So that, to make what I call eumol-
pique verses, it suffices to avoid the meeting oi finals ol the
same kind, whose impact necessitates the rhyme, by making
one kind succeed another continually, and opposing alter-
nately the masculine and feminine, the mingling ol which is
irrelevant to eumolpoeia. Here is all the mechanism of my
verses: they are fluent as to form; as to the essence which is
expedient for them—that is another thing: ior it is rarely
encountered.
