2‘74 The Golden Verses of Pythagoras

reflected upon all Nature. It is the chain of communication
between all beings. All the series of animals [he adds in an·
other place] present only a long degradation from the proper
nature of man. The monkey, considered either in his exterior
form or in his interior organisation, resembles only a degraded
mam and the same suggestion of degradation is observed in
passing from monkeys to quadrupeds; so that the primitive
trend of the organization is recognized in all, and the principal
viscera, the principal members are identical there?¹

Who knows [observes elsewhere the same writer] who knows
if in the eternal night of time the sceptra of the world will not
pass from the hands of man into those of a being more worthy
of bearing it and more perfect? Perhaps the rece of negroes,
today secondary in the human specie, has already been queen
of the earth before the white rece was created. . . . If Nature
has successively accorded the empire to the species that it creates
more and more perfect, why should she cease today. . . . The
negro, already king of animals, has fallen beneath the yoke of
the European; will the latter bow the head in histum before a
race more powerful and more intelligent when it enters into the
plans of Nature to ordain his existence? Where will his crea·
tion stop? Who will place the limits of his power? God alone
raises it and it is His all-powerful hand which governs?

These striking passages full of forceful ideas, which
appear neW, and which would merit being better known,
contain only a small part of the things taught in the ancient
mysteries as I shall perhaps demonstrate later.

Owise and happy man, rest in its honen.
But observa my laren obstoining from the things
Which thy soni must seor, distinguishing them welk
Letting intelligente o’er thy body reign.
