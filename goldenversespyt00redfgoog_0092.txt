The Essence and Fonn of Poetry 69

of song, gay and sprightly, ordinarily a parody upon a
more serious subject, and which, because it was quite fre·
quently sung with an air ol the dance accompanied by the
ridle or hardy-gurdy, their lavourite instmment, was called
auu-deridle, or as is pronounced today, vaudeville.¹

Τὴε Italians and Spaniards, who received from the
oscan troubadours their first impulse toward poetry, would
have been perhaps as limited as they, to composing amorous
sonnets, madrigals or, at the most, certain vehement sylves²
if the Greeks, driven from their country by the conquests ol
Mohammed II., had not brought them the works of the
ancients as 1 have already said. These works, explained
in the chaire pullique, due to the munificence ol the Medicis,

luldon.

The sylves, called sines or umentes by the troubadours, were kinds ol
