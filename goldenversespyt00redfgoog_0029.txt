6 The Golden Verses of Pythagoras

my autumn advances, whereas it was unable to move me
when the effervescence of my springtime ought to have
doubled its strength? No: however flattering the wreaths
that you award to talent, they would not oonoern me; and
ii an interest, as new as powerful, had not induoed meto
addressyou,1 would keep silent. This interest, Massam,
is that which science itself inspires in me, and the desire,
perhaps inconsiderate but commendable, of cooperating with
my limited ability for the development of a language whose
literary and moral influence, emerging from the bourns of
Europe and the present century, ought to invade the world
and become universal like the renown of the hero who
extends his conquests with those of the empire whose
foundations he has laid.

1 feel, Mesrieurs, that I should explain my thought.
My assertion, well founded as it may be, appears none the
less extraordinary, and I am bound to admit this. The
disfavour which is attached to all new ideas, to all innova·
tions, the just defiance that they inspira, the element oi
' ridicule that springs from their downfall, would have ar·
rested my audacity, if I had had audacity alone, and if the
worthy ambition of effecting a general good had not raised
me above a particular evil which might have resulted forme.
Besides I have counted upon the judicious good-will of the
two illustrious Academias to which I am addressing myself:
1 have thought that they would distinguish in the verse
which I am presenting for their examination, both as a
means of execution in French poetry and as a means of
translation in ancient and foreign poetry, the real utility
that they can offer, of the fortuitous beauty which they
lack, and which a more capable hand would have been able
to give them; I flatter myself, at length, that they would
grant to the end, without prejudice, the attention which is
necessary, and that if they refused an entire approbation to
my efforts, they would at least render justice to my real and
commend the motives which have made me attempt them.
