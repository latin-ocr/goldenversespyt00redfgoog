50 The Golden Verses of Pythagoras Ι

that which is dazzling and beautiful, that which is sublime
and protective, has had the same signification in Phoeni·
ciam* and that it is from this same name tc which is joined
a demonstrative article common to Aramaic, Chaldean, and
Syriae, that the word drama** is formed, and which being
adopted by the Greek tongue, has passed afterwards into
the Latin tongue and into curs. This word has expressed
an action, because, in truth, it depicts one in the mysteries
and besides its primitive root refers to regular movement
in general.

But as my purpose is not to follow at present dramatic
art in all its rarnifications and as it suffices me to have indi-
cated clearly the origin, 1 return to Greece.

The spectacle of which I have spoken, effect of a Bacchic
enthusiasm‚ and at first abandoned to the caprice of certain
rustic grapegatherers whose indiscretions did not appear
formidable, struck so forcibly by its novelty and produced
such a marvellous effect upon the people, that it was not
long before certain men of most cultivated minds were seen
desirous of taking part either from liking or from interest.
Thespis and Susarion appeared at the same time and each
seized, according to his character, one the noble and serious
side and the other the ridiculous and amusing side of the

mythological fables; dividing thus from its birth, dramatic
‘ Rama is, in Sanskrit, the name of that which is dazzling, elevated, white,

sublime, protective, beautiful, excellent. This word has exactly the same sense
in the Phoenician nt (ram). Its primitive root, which is universalized by

,Ι the tenuarique letter b (m), is nn (rc), which has reference tc the harmonic

movernent cf good, of light, and cf sight. The name of the adversary of
Rama, Rawlron, is formed from the root nn (nauh) which expresses, on the
contrary, the discrdered movement of evil and cf lire, and which, becoming
unioed with the augmentative syllable n (tn), depicts whatever ravages and
ruins; this is the signification which it has in Sanskrit.

” From the word reon (rama) is formed in Phoenician the word aon
(drama) by the adjunction cf the demonstrative article Ἰ (d’); that is to say,
a thing which comes from Ram: an action well ordered, beautiful, sublime,
etc. Notice that the Greek verb δραεΐν, ιο oct, whence is drawn very inap-
prcpriately the word δρᾶμα, is always attached to the same root nn (ra)
which is that cf hannonie movement.
