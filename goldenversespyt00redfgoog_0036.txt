The Essence and Form oi Poetry 13

I am addressing men who are too enlightcned to ignore what
the ancients have said in this respect. Heraclides, whom
· I have already cited, is not the only one who has given this
impression. Strabo assures positively that ancient poetry
was only the language of allegory,¹ and hc refutes Eratos
'thenas who pretended that the aim of Homer was only to
amuse and plesse. In this he is in acoord with Denys of
Halicarnassus who avows that the mysteries of nature and
the most sublime oonoeptions of morals have been eovered
with the veil of allegory.² Phumutus goos larther: he
declares that the allegories used by Hesiod and by Homer
do not differ from those which other foreign poets have used
before them.³ Damascius said as much of the poems of
Orpheus,⁴ and Plutarch confirms it in a passage which has
been preserved to us by Eusebius⁵

In the first ages of Greece, poctry, consecrated to the
service of the altars, left the enclosures of the temples only
for the instruction of the people: it was as a sacred languagc
in which the priests, entrusted with presiding at the mys-
teries of religion, interpreted the will ol the gods. The
eracles, dogmas, moral precepts, religious and civil laws,
reachings of all sorts conceming the labours of the body, the
operations ol the mind, in fact all that which was regarded
as an emanation, an order, or a favour from the Divinity,
all was written in verse. To this sacred language was
given the name Poctry, that is to say, the Language of the
Gods: a symbolic name which acoords with it perlectly,
since it expressed at the same time its on'gin and its usage.⁶
It was said to have oome from Thrace, ⁷ and the one who had
invented it and caused its first accents to be heard was
