The Essence and Form of Poetry 95

lor Lucan, creaturos a mixed style, had no inspiration that
he could communicate.
. I have said what I thought of Camoens: it isuseless to
quote the exposition of his poem that has nothing remark·
able, particularly since Tasso has so iar surpassed him.
Tasso was worthy of receiving a veritable inspiration.
His lofty genius, his pure and brilliant imagination brought
him nearer to Vergil than to Ariosto; and if he had been
inspired even through the Latin poet, he would have shown
Europe what the magnetic power of Homer was, although
acting only in its third degree. But the prejudicesof educa-
tion working in him even without his knowledge, and the
influence that chivalresque poetry had attained in Italy,
did not permit him either to forsake entirely the chroniclas
of Archbishop Turpin, or above all, to make any changes in
the consecrated form. All that he could do in a most
grave and serious historical subject was to mix a little alle·
gorical genius with a great deal of romanasque ficti0n; so
that, becoming inspired at the same time with Ariosto,
Lucan, and Vergil, he made a mixed work, which, under the
form of a lengthy song, contained the essence of epopoeia,
of history, and of romanoe. This work is one of the most

entertaining poems that one can read; the only one perhaps Ἰ

which a translation in prose can hami but little. The in-
equality of its texture takes away nothing from the interest
that it inspires. It pleases, but it does not instruct. Il
the eumolpique lines were applied to it throughout, it would
not sustain them3 for it is in substance only a very beau·
tiful ballad; nevertheless, here and there are found parts
which could become sublime. His exposition, imitating
Vergil, reveals them very well. They are as follows:

Je chante les combats pieux, et le Guerrier
Qui delivra du Christ la tombe renommee.
Combien il deploya de genie et d'ardeur!
Combien il supporta de maux dans oette guerrel
