18 The Golden Verses ol Pythagoras

he mentions in the Odyssey an oracle delivered by Apollo
upon Parnassus. For a long time, the peoples oi Greece,
accustomed to receive from the ancient mountains oi Thrace
both their oracles and their instructions turned toward
that country and neglected the new sacred mount. This
is why the most ancient traditione place in Thrace,
with the supremacy of cult and sacerdotalism, the cradle
of the most famous poets and that of the Muses who
had inspired them: Orpheus, Musaeus, Thamyris, and
Eumolpus were Thracians. Pieria, where the Muses
were born, was a mountain oi Thraoe; and when, at
length, it was a question of rendering to the gods a severe
and orthodox cult, it was said that it was necessary to
imitate the Thracians, or, as one would say in French,
thracisce*

Besides it must be observed, that at the epoch when “
the temple oi Delphi was founded, the new cult, presented
ί to the Greeks under the name of the universal Olen, tended
to unite Apollo and Diana, or the sun and the moon, under
the same symbolic figure, and to make oi it only one
and the same object oi adoration, under the name oi OEto
linos, that is to say, Suu-owarti It was proclaimed that
the middle of the earth, its patemal and maternal umbilicus,
was found placed exactly on the spot where the new sacred
city was built, which was called ior this mystiml reason

‘The Greek word Θρᾴκη, Thrace, in passing into the Ionian dialect Oedi,
bas furnished the following expressions: θρῆσκω, a devotee, θρησκεία, devo·
tion, θρησκηύω, Ι adore with devotion. These words, diverted irem their
real sense and used ironically aiter the cult oi Thrace had yielded to that oi
Delphi, were applied to ideas of superstition and even oi ianaticism. The
pointel considering the Thracians as schismatica was even reached, and the
· word remman composed to express a heresy, a cult particular to those
who practised it, and separated from orthodoxy.

tOEtolinos is composed, by contractiori, oi two words which appear to
belong to one oi the Thracian dialects. OEtoKyros significa the mling sun,
among the Scythiana according to Herodotus (l. iv„ 59). Heleno signihed
the moon, among the Dorians. lt is from this last word, deprived oi its
article he, that the Latius have made Luna.
