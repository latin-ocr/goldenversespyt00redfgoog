The Essence and Form of Poetry 77

rhymed; their number is immense their variety infinite.
Nothing equals the industry and delicacy oi the Indian
rhymers in this style. 'ibe Arabs all skilful as they were,
the Osean trouhadours whose rhyme was their sole merit,
have never approaehed their models.¹ Thus, not only does
one find among the Indians the measured verse ol the
Greeks and Romans, not only does one see there rhythms
unknown to these two peoples, hut one recognizes also
there our rhyme with combinations oi which we have
no idea.

I ought to make an important observation here: it is,
that whereas India, mistress of Asia, held the sceptro ol the
earth, she still recognized only the eumolpoeia of the Vedos
and the Pouronos, only the epopoeia ol Maho-Bhoroto and
dre Romam· her poetry was the language of the gods
and she gave herself the name ol Ponyo-Rhoumi, Land of
virtues. It was only when a long prosperity had enervated
her, that the love for novelty, the caprice ol lashion and
perhaps, as it happened in Greece, the deviation of the
thaatre, caused her to seek ior beauties foreign to veiitable
poetry. Itis not a rare thing to pass the point of perfectiori
when one has attained it. The astonishing flexibility of
Sanslnit, the abundance ol its final consonants opens a
double means for corruption. Poets multiplied words
believing to multiply ideas, they doubled rhymes; they
tripled them in the same verse believing te increase pro·
portionably its harmony. Their imagination bending be·
iore an inspiriug genius became vagabond; they thought to
rise to the sublime, and fell into the bombastic. At last,
knowing no longer how to give emphasis and impor-
tanoe to their extravagant thoughts, they created words
of such length that, in order to contain them, it was
necessary to forge verses oi four caesuros of nineteen ’

syllables each.²
