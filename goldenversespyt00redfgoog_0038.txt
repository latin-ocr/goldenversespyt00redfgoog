The Essence and Form oi Poetry 15

under the sun which cannot find either its model or its copy)
when the Europeans took possession of America and colo-
nized it, and carried to those regions their diverse dialects
and covered it with names drawn from the mysteries of
Christianity. One ought therefore, when one wishestounder·
stand the ancient names of the countries of Greeoe, those of
their heroic personages, those of the mysterious subjecte ol
their cult, tn have recourse to the Phoenician dialect which
although lost to us can easily be restored with the aid ol
Hebrew Arammc, Chaldean, Syriae, Arabio, and Coptic.

I do not intend, Messieurs, to fatigue you with proofs of
these etymologies which are not in reality the subject of
’ my discourse. Iam content to place them on the margin
ior the satisfaction of the curicus. Thus Ι shall make use
of them later, when occasion demands. But to retum to
Thrace, this country was always considered by the Greeks
as the place peculiar to> their gods and the oentre of their
cult; the divine country, por excellence. All the names that
it has borne in different dialccts and which in the course
oi time have become concentrated in particular regions,
have been synonyme of theirs. Thus Getae, Moesia, Dacia,
all signify the country of the gods* Strab0, in speaking
oi the Getae, said that these peoples recognized a sovereign
pontifi to whom they gave the title oi God, the dignity of
which existed still in his time¹ This sovereign pontifi

'The Getae, in Greek Γέται, were, according to AElius Spartianus, and
according to the author olle Mende primitis (t. ix„ p. 49), the same peoples
es the Goths. Their country called Getae, which should be pronounoed
. 'Cluentia comes irom the word Goth, which significa God in most oi the idioms
oi the north oi Europe. The name oi the Dacians is only a soitening oi that
ol the Thracicos in a different dialect.

Moesia, in Greek Μοίσω, is, in Phoenician, the interpretation ol the name
given to Thrace. The latter means, as we have seen, etherecl space, and the
³ former signifies divine rhode, being composed from the word mh (dish), whose
rendering I have already given, before which is found placed the letter n
(M), one oi the himantiques, which according to the best grammarians serves
to express the proper place, the means, the loml manifestation ol a thing.
