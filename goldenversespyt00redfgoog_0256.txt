Examinations os the Golden Verses 233

Man, and having shown the intimate composition ot this
Being image of the Universe, according to the doctrine of
the ancients, I ought perhaps to use all the means in my
power, in order to demonstrate with what facility the physi-
cal and metaphysica] phenomena which result from their
combined action can be deduced; but such an undertaking
would necessarily draw me into details foreign to these
examinations. I must again put off this point as I have put
off many others; I will take them up in another work, if the
savants and the thinkers to whom I address myself approve
the motive which has put the pen in my hand.

26. Bul before all, thy soul to ils faithful duty,
ι Invoke these Gods with seroour, they whose ahl,
Thy work begun, alone eon terminate.

All the cults established upon the face of the earth have
made a religious duty of prayer. This alone would prove,
if it were necessary, what 1 have advanced conceming the
theosophical dogma of the volitive liberty of man; for if man
were not free in his actions, and ii an irresistible fatality
led him on to misfortune and to crime, what use would be
invoking the gods, imploring their assistance, begging them
to turn aside from him the evils which must inevitably
overwhelm him? If, as Epicurus taught, an impenetrable
barrier separated gods and men; if these gods, absorbed in
their beatitude and their impassive immortality, were such
strangers to the evils of humanity that they neither troubled
to alleviate them nor to prevent them, ior what purpose
then the incense burning at the foot of their altars?⁰

It was, he said, on account os the excellence of their
nature that he honoured thern thus, and not from any
motive of hope or sear, not expecting any good from them
and not dreading any evil.l What miserable sophism!
