224 The Golden Verses os Pythagoras

anterior to those ol the other Indian nations, establish the
same division, The Rahans, who fill the sacerdotal offices
among these peoples, teaeh a doctrine conformable to that
of the mysterics. They say that inequality among men is
a necessary consequence ol their past virtues or past vices,
and that they are born in a nation more or less enlightened,
in a caste, in a family, more cr less illustrious, according to

of Pythagoras; but no one has expressed it with greater
force and clearnoes than Kong-Tse. I think I have no noed
to say that these two sagos did not copy each other. The
assent that they gave to the same idea had its source else
where than in sterile imitation.

The Chinese people, from time immemorial, have been
