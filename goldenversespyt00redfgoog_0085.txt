ι 62 The Golden Verses os Pythagoras

Lucretius wh0, being inspired by the works oi Leucippus
and of Epicurus¹ wrote a book upon the nature of things,
which has never been as yet well comprehended or well
translated, the language not being understood.

Comedy, reformed by Menander, was again improved
by Plautus and by Terence who acquired much reputation
in this style; as to dramatic art in itseli, it remained in its
inertia. The Romans having the same gods and nearly
the same mythology as the Greeks, were neither sufficiently
elevated in intelligence to reinstate this art and make of
it the masterpiece of the human mind; nor sufficiently
advanced in exact knowledge to change wholly its forms and
make of it, as we have, a new art, whence allegory and the
moral part of Eumolpoeia have been completely banished.
But what the Romans were unable to do for dramatic art,
they unfortunately were able to do for Epopoeia. Certain
writers, able versifiers‚ but absolutely deprived of intellec·
tual inspiration, incapable of distinguishing in poetry the
essence from the form, following what the degenerated
theatre and the inspired declamations of Euhemerus² had
taught them, imagined foolishly that the gods and heroes
oi antiquity having been only men stronger and more power-
ful than the others mythology was only a crude collection
of historic facts disfigured‚ and Epopoeia only an emphatic

’ discourse upon these same facts.³ Thereupon they be-

lieved that it was only a question of taking any historic
subject whatever, and relating it in verse with certain em-

¹The real founder ol the Atomic system such as has been adopted by
Lucretius (De Rerum Notum, l. i), was Moschus, Phoenician philosopher
whose works threw light upon those oi Leucippus (Posidonius cite par strabon,
l. xvi, Sext. Empiric, Ado. mutem.. p. 367). This system well understood,
does not dilier from thet ol the monads, oi which leibnitz was the inventor.

'Voltsira who has adopted this error, has founded it upon the significa
tion of the word Epos, which he has connected with that oi Disoourse (Dic-
ts'onn. philos. au mot Enoria). But he is mistaken. The Greek word 1¹⁰5
is translated accurately by tusus. Thence the verb aas, to follow in the
tracks, to turn, to go, in the same sense.
