The Essence and Form ol Poetry 71

others had attempted, with the example of Homer, to bring
back to the unity of epopoeia, the incongruous and fantastic
soenes ol the romanoe, when Ariosto appeared. This man,
gifted with a keen and brilliant imagination, and possessor
of a matchless talent, executed what no one else had been
able to do before him; he was neither inspired by Homer,
nor by Vergil; he copied no one. He learned from them
only to raise himself to the poetic source, to see it where it
was aud to draw from it his genius. Then he received a
first inspiration and became the creator ol a particular
style ol poetry which may be called romantic. Undoubtedly
this style is greatly inferior to epopoeia; but after all it is
original: its beauties as well as its faults belong to him.
Almost the same moment when An'osto enriched Europe
with his new poetry, Camoens wished to naturalize it in
Portugal; but the melonge of Vergil and' Lucan that he
essayed to make, betrayed his lack of understanding and
he did not succeed. Ι mention it only that you may ob·
serve, Messieurs, that the form adopted by the Portuguese
poet is exactly the same as the one which Ariost0‚ his pre·
decessors and his successorS, have followed in Italy: it is
that of the troubadours. The poems oi each are long ballads,
intersected by strophes of eight lines ol alternate rhymes
which, succeeding one another with the same measure, can
be sung from one end to the other, with an appropriate air,
and which in lact, as J. J. Rousseau has very well remarked,
were sung frequently. In these poemS, the essence is in
accord with the form, and it is this that makes their regu-
larity. It is not the epopoeia ol Homer drawn from the
Orphic source, it is the romantio poetry oi Ariosto, an issue
of the fictions attributed to Archbishop Turpin, which is
associated with the verses oi the troubadours. These

oedous subject, which agrees with the struente. The poems oi Bojardo, ol
Arioato, of Tasso, are, as to form, only long ballads. They are poems because
of the unity which, notwithstanding the innumerable episodes with which
they are filled, constituted the principal subject.
