Examinations ol the Golden Verses 131

conceive or understand. His infinity consists in His per·
sections, His faculties, His attributes, of which the vulgar
can, according to the measure of their understanding, grasp
some ieeble emanationS, and draw nearer to Him by detach·
ing them from the universality—-that is, by particularizing
and personiiying them. This is the particularization and
the personification which constitutes‚ as I have said, poly-
theism. The mass of gods which result from it, is as infi-
nite as the Divinity itseli whence it had birth. Each nation‚
each pecple, each city adopts at its liking, those oi the divine
iaculties which are best suited to its character and its re·
quirements. These faculties‚ represented by simulacra,
become so many particular gods whose variety oi names
augments the number still further. Nothing can limit this
immense theogcny‚ since the Primal Cause whence it eman-
ates has not done so. The vulgar, lured by the objects
which strike the senseS, can become idolatrouS, and he does
ordinarily; he can even distinguish these objects oi his
adoration, one from another, and believe that there really
exist as many gods as statues; but the sage, the philosopher.
the most ordinary man oi letters does not fall intoythis error.
He knows, with Plutarch, that different places and names
do not make different gods; that the Greeks and Barbarians,
the nations oi the North and those oi the South, adore the
same Divinity⁰3 he restores easily that infinity of attri-
butes to the unity oi the essenee, and as the honoured rern-
nants oi the ancient SramanaS, the priests of the Burmans,
still do today, he worships God, whatever may be the

Α altar, the temple, and the place where he finds himself!

lThe priests ol the Burmans, called Rabona but whose generic nemeis
that oi Srcmono, whence cameto them that cl stamnum, which the an·
cients gave them, carry the spirit ci tolerance as iar as possible. They visit
with the same devotion pagodas‚1nosqucs‚and churches; never does one see
them being persecuted‚ nor persecuting others in the cause ci religion. The
Brahmans‚ Mussulmans. and Christians occupy important posts among them
without their being scandalized. They regard all rnen as brothers. (Anat.
