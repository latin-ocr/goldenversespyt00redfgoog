68 The Golden Verses os Pythagoras

along time our only bibliotheca, that we owe a new style of
poetry, called Romanesque, on account of the Romance
tongueinwhich it had birth.¹ This style istothe eumolpique

brarnbleoovered land, is to a cultivated tree which rises
majestically in the heart of a fertile country.

It was with the chivalrous ideas, inspired by the book
of the monk of Saint Andre, that the first poetic ideas were
brought forth in France. The Oscan troubadours seizing
these first glimmerings ol genius, threw themselves with

spoken in the north. Itis from the longae d'oil tlmt the French descend.
The languedoc, prevailing with the troubadours who cultivated it, disappeared
with them in the iourteenth century and was lost in numberless obscure
provincial dialeets. Voyez Le Troubodour, poesia oceanique. a la Dissert,
