20 The Golden Verscs 01 Pathagoras

for the support of the same doctrine. For it is well to
remember that the Qssffloel. history of these remote times,
written in a different spir‘ii'from the positive history which
has succeeded it, resembled it in no ways'and that it is in
having confused them that so many grave errors have arisen.
It is a very important observation that I again make here.
This history, confided to the memory 01 men or preserved
among the sacerdotal archives of the temples in detached
fragments of poetry, considered things only from the moral
side, was never occupied with individuals, but saw only the
masses; that is to say, peoples, corporations, sects, doctrines,
even arts and sciences, as so many particular beings that

of all were accumulated upon the head of one alone. It
was the moral thing whose course was examined, whose
birth, progress, or downfall was described. The succession
of things replaced that 01 individuals. Positive history,
which ours has become, follows a method entirely different.
The individuals are everything for it: it notes with scrupu-
lous exactitude dates and facts which the other scoms.
Ido not pronounce upon their common merit. The moderns
would mock that allegorical manner 01 the ancients, if they
could believe it possible, as I am persuaded the ancients
would have mocked the method of the moderns, had they
been able to foresee its possibility in the future. How
approve ol what is unknown? Man approves of only what
he likes; he always believes he lmows all that he ought to
like.

I can say, after having repeated this observation, that
the poet Linus, who is regarded as the author 01 all the
melancholy chants of the ancient world, represents nothing
