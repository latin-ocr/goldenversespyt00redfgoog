The Essence and Form ol Poetry 103

proud nation had assumed over public opinion¹ Not·
withstanding the efforts of Comeille, of Racine, and of
Moliere, the Theatre Francais retained always the roman-
esque tone that it had originally received. All that these
three men could do was, by lofty sentiments, by pun'ty of
forms, by regularity of the customs and characters, to pass
over what was, in reality, defective. They came thus to
give to modern dramatie art all the perfection of which it
was susceptible. Shakespeare had been in London the
successor of AEschylus; Comeille received in France the
inspiration of Sophocles; Racine, that of Euripides; and
Moliere united as in a sheaf the spirit of Menander, of
Terence, and oi Plautus.

When Ι compare Shakespeare with AEschylus, I want
to make it clearly understood that I regard him as the re-
generator of the theatre in Europe, and superior to Corneille
and Racine as to dramatie essence, although he may be
assuredly much inferior to them as to form. AEschylus,

¹The tragedy oi the Cid, given by Pierre Comeille in 1626, upon which
were based the grandeur and dominant charaeta ol the Theatra Franpais,
as well as the renown ol the author, is taken from a Spanish ballad very oele·
brated ia Spain. The Cid, who is the hero oi it, lived towards the close oi the
eleventh century. lle was a type oi the paladins and knights errant oi na
romanasque traditions. He enjoyed a wide reputation and attained a high
degree oi fortune. Voyea Monte-Mayor, Diana, 1.ii.; etVoltaire, Essos' sar
les Moeurs, t. iii, stereotypa p. 86.

In the course of the sixteenth century, the Spanish held a marked superi·
ority over the other peoples: their tongue was spoken at Paris, Vienna, Milan,
Turia. Their customs, their manners oi thought and oi writing, subjugated
the minds oi the Italians, and irom Charles V. to the commencement ol the
reign of Philip 111.. Spain enjoyed an importance that the other peoples never
had. Voyez Robertson, Introduction d l’Histoire de Charias-Quint.

It would be necessary to overstep considerably the ordinary limits oi a
iootnote, 11 1 should explain how it happens that Spain has lost this supranacy
aoquired by her, and why her tongue, the only one capable oi rivalling aad
perhaps effacing the French, has yielded to it in all ways, and by which it was
eclipsed. This explanation would demand ior itseli alone a very lengthy
work. Among the writers who have sought lor the came oi the decadenae
oi the Spanish monarehy, some have believed to discover it in the increase oi
its wealth, others, in the too great extent oi its colonias, aad the greater part,
