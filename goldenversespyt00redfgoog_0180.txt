accustomed to worship in polytheism the Divine lnfinity
and not its Unity, did not find it strange to be guided,
protected, and watched over on the one side, whereas they
remained, on the other, free in their movements; and they
did not trouble themselves to find the source oi good and
evil since they saw it in the objects of their cult, in these -
same gods, the greater part of whom being neither essen·
tially good nor essentially bad were reputed to inspire in
them the virtues or the vices which, gathered freely by them,
rendered them worthy oi recompense or chastisement.⁰
But when Natural Philosophy appeared, the lace oi things
was changed. The natural philosophers, substituting the ob·
servation of nature and experience ior mental contempla-
tion and the inspiration oi theosophists, thought that they
could make sentient what was intelligible, and promised to
prove by fact and reasoning whatever up to that time had
had only proofs oi sentiment and analogy. They brought
to light the great mystery oi Universal Unity, and trans·
forming this Intellectual Unity into corporal substance
placed it in water? in infinite space,‘ in the air,d in the
fire,‘ whence they draw in turn the essential and formal
existence of all things. The one, attached to the school of
Ionia, established as fundamental maxim, that there is but
one principle oi all; and the other, attached to that of Elea,

oon consult in the course oi the Eddo, the sublime discourse ol Odin, entitled
Hovamdt. The basis ol all these works is the same.

⁰ This, as 1 observed in my Second Examination, should be understood
only by the vulgar. The savant and the initiate easily restored to Unity
this infinity ol gods, and understood or sought the origin oi evil, without the
knowledge ol which, divine Unity is inexplicable.
