Examinations of the Golden Verses 185

the Universa is passing. These two methods have grave
disadvantages. The first appears even impossible. For
what is the duration of the great year? What is the immense
period, which, containing the circle oi all possible aspects
and of all corresponding effects, as Cicero supposes, is able,
by observations made and set down in the genethliatic
archives, to foresee, at the second revolution, the retum of
the events which were already linked there and which must
be reproduced?⁰ Plato exacts, for the perlection of this
great year, that the movement of the fixed stars, which
constitutes what we call the precession of the equinoxes,
should coincide with the particular movement ol the celes·
tial bodies, so asto bring back the heavens to the fixed
point of its primitive position.l The Brahmans carry
the greatest duration oi this immense period, which they
name Kalpe, to 4,320,000,ooo of years, and its mean dura·
tion, which they name Malta-Youg, to 4,320,000.‘ The
Chiuese appear to restrict it to 432,000 years⁴ and in
this they agree with the Chaldeans; but when one reduces
it again to a twelfth of this number, with the Egyptians,
that is, to the sole revolution of the fixed stars, which they
made, according to Hipparchus, 36,000 years, and which
we make no more than 25,867, according to modern calcula·
tions,‘ we feel indeed that we would be still very far from
having a series ol observations capable of making us foresee
the retum of the same events, and that we could not con·
ceive even, how men could ever attain to its mastery. As
to the second method, which consists, as 1 have said, in
carrying iorward the moral sight upon the route which one
has before him, I have no need to observe that it can be
only very conjectural and very uncertain, since it depends
upon a faculty which man has never possessed except as a
special favour of Providence.
