Examinations of the Golden Verses 187

some portion of an existing sphere and already traversed,
it belonged thus to the domain of N ecessity and could be
knownÍ¾ and, secondarily, that the analogical rapport ruling
between the sentient sphere that one exanrined and the
intelligible sphere that one could not perceive, authorized
drawing inferences from both and even deciding from the
general to the particular? For, believing that the stars
have an actual and direct influence upon the destiny of
peoples and of men, and that they even determine this
destiny by their good or evil aspects, is an idea as false as
ridiculous, born oi the darkness of modern times, and that
is not found among the ancients even among the most
ignorant massas. The genethliatical science is supported
by principles less absurd. These principles, drawn from
the mysteries, were, as I have explained, that the future is
a return of the past and that nature is everywhere the same.

It is from the union of these two principles that resulted
genethlialogy, or the science by which the point oi depar-
ture being known in any sphere whatever, they believed
they had discovered, by the aspect and direction of the
stare, the portion of this sphere which must immediately
follow this point. But this union, outside of the enormous
difficulty that it presented, still involved in its execution
very dangerous consequences. This is why they concealed
in the sanctuaries the science which was its object, and made
of religion a secret and state affair. The prevision oi the
future, supposing it possible as the ancients did, is not, in
effect, a seience that one should abendon to the vulgar, who,
being unable to acquire previously the learning necessary,
and having but rarely the wisdom which regulates its use,
risked debasing it, or making use of it wrongfully. Further-
more, the pontifis, who were in sole charge, initiated in the
great mysteries and possessing the ensemblc of the doctrine,
knew very well that the future, such even as they could
hope to understand it in the perfectiori of the scienoe, was
never aught but a doubtful future, a sort of canvas upon
