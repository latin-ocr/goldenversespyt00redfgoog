182 The Golden Verses ol Pythagoras

one penetratas still deeper into the meaning ol this line, it
is seen that it proceeds from principles previously laid down
regarding the necessity of Destiny aud the power of the
Will; and that Pythagoras neglected no opportunity for
making his disciples leel that, although forced by Destiny
to find themselves in such or such a condition, they remained
free to weigh the consequenoes of their action, and to decide
themselves upon the part that they ought to take. The
following lines are, as it were, the corollary or his counsel.

Thou shouldst, in the present, contemplate the future.

That is to say, thou shouldst consider what will be the
results ol such or such action and think that these results
dependent upon thy will (while the action remains in sus·
pense and free, while they are yet to be born), will become
the domain ol Necessity the very instant when the action
will be executed, and increasing in the past, once they shall
have had birth, will cooperate in forming the plan of a new
future.

find here the veritable source oi the astrologica] science oi
the ancients. Doubtless he is not ignorant oi what an
extended influence this science exercised already upon the
iace of the globe. The Egyptians, Chaldeans‚ Phoenicians,
did not separate it from that which regulated the cult oi
the gods!l Their temples were butan abridged image oi
the Universe, and the tower which served as an observa-
tory was raised at the side of the sacrificial altar. The
Peruvians followed, in this respect, the same usages as
the Greeks and Romans.b Everywhere the grand Pontiff
