The Essence and Form of Poetry 109

or unknown to him; so that if he should choose either the
downfall of Man, as Milton, or his rehabilitation, after the
example of Klopstock, he would be able to acquaint himself
with the inner meaning of these mysterius, to explain all the
conditions, to comprehend the beginning and the end, and,
raising himself to the intellectual nature where they had
birth, to spread light upon physical nature. This is the
first attainment that I deem indispensable to the epic poet;
Isay that he should understand what he would sing. ⁴Homer

governed by the Principle of evil, and as such consigned to
eternal damnation. An insurmountable barrier separates
the personages and makes them not alone enemies, but
opposed, as much as good and evil, light and darkness.
However, the passions act unknown even to the poet; the
reader is hurried along, he forgets the fatal line of demerea-
tion, and is deceived into becoming interested in Satan,
into finding great, beautiful, and terrible, this enemy of
mankind3 he trusts in Armida, he is moved by her troubles,
and seconds with his vows those of a notorious magician,
instrument of the Infernal Spirit. Matters go not thus
with Homer. The Greeks see in the Troiane, enemies,
and not reprobates. Paris is culpable but not impious.
Hector is a hero in whom one can be interested without
