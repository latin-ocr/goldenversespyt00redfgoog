190 The Golden Verses ol Pythagoras

tell me with the same phlegmatic air that the Greeks of the
time ol Homer knew neither how to read nor how to write;
that this poet himself, assuming that he really existed, did
not know the letters ol the alphabet‘; but that his exist·
enoe is a lancy? and that the works attributed to him
are the crude productions ol oertain plagiarist rhapsodists.‘
Further on I see, to complete the singularity, a research
worker who finds, doubtlees to the support ol all this, that
the first editor ol the poems ol Homer, the virile legislator
ol Sparta, Lycurgus in short, was a man ignorant and un·
lettered, knowing neither how to read nor write⁴1 quite
an original idea and a comparison wholly bizarre, between
the author and the editor oi the Iliad l But this is nothing.
Here is an archbishop ol Thessalonica, wh0, animated by a
righteous indignation, declared that Homer may have been
an instrument oi the devil,‘ and that one may be damned
in reading him. That one shrugs the shoulders at the alle
gories ol this poet, that one finds them not in the least inter-
esting, that one falls asleep even, let all that pass; but
to be damned! Ι have said that Bacon, drawn along unior·
tunately by that fatal prejudice which makes one judge
without understanding, had calumniated the philosophy
ol the Greeks; his numerous disciples have even surpassed
him upon this point. Condillac, the coryphte ol modern
empiricism, has seen in Plato only delirious metaphysics
unworthy ol occupying his time, and in Zeno only logie
deprived ol reasoning and principles. Ι would that Con·
dillac, so great an amateur of analysis, had endeavoured to
analyse the metaphysics of the one and the logie ol the other,

the modern sculptors would have said that the ancients lailed as much in
pattem as in coloun'ng.
