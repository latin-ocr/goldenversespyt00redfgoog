The Essence and Form ol Poetry 85

uris career: it is assuredly not by my poor poetic talent that
I have aspired to the honour of occupying your attention;
but by a generous instinct, which, making me ignore many
oi the considerations which might have arrested me, has
persuaded me that I could be useful. I have dared to con·
ceive the possibility of composing, in French, eumolpique
verse, which might neither be measured by musical rhythm
foreign to our tongue, nor enchained by rhyme opposed to
all intellectual and rational movement, and which however
might have neither the harshness, nor the discord of that
which has been called, up to this time, blank verse.

Many French writers have tried to make verse deprived
oi rhyme. Some have sought to imitate the measures of
the ancients, others have satisfied themselves with copying
certain moderns who do not rhyme. Each of thern has
misunderstood the essential character of his tongue. Vos·
sius alone appears to have foreseen the principles without
developing them, when he has said that French verse might
be considered as having only one foot.¹ This is exactly
true in examining rhythm only in itself, and giving to each
hemistich the name of time: but if one considers this one
foot, whether hexameter or pentameter, as formed of two
times equal or unequal, it is perceived that it participateS,
through its final, in two natures: the one strong andforce·
ful, that we name masculine, the other soft and languid,
that we callfeminine. Therefore, French verse having but
oue rhythmic foot, differs however, in the style of this loot
and can be considered in two relations. Let us take ior
‘example the hexameter verse. The rhythmic foot which
constitutas it is composed of two equal times distinguished
by the casura, the last of which is masculine or feminine:
Masculine, as in:

Rome, l’unique objet de mon ressentiment!
Rome, aqui vient ton bras d'irnmoler mon amanti

'vomas De Poemotum contu el viribus rhythmo cite par J. J. Roussesu,
Didionrroire de Musicae, art. Rursus.
