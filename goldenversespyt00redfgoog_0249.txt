226 The Golden Verses of Pythagoras

3ηά sublimest, compr-isos the extraordinary men, who unite in
their persons the qualities oi the spirit and beart, perfectad by the
blessed habitos iulfilling voluntarily 3ηά joyfully, what nature
and morals impose jointly upon reasonable beings living in
society. Imperturbable in their mode oi life, like unto the sun
and the moon, the heavens and the earth, they never cease their
beneficent operations; they act by intelligence and as spirits see

without being seen. This class, very lew in number, can be called
that oi the Periect ones, the Saints.⁶

Ι have transcribed what has just been read without
changing a single word. If the reader has given to this
extract the attention that it ments, he will have seen the
doctrine oi Pythagoras such as Ι have revealed 3ηά the
important distinction between Instinct, Reason, and Intel-
ligence such as Ι have established; he will have seen the

of men, of which Ι have spoken, and will have easily reoog·
nized, in the right reason which constitutas the third class
according to the Chinese theosophist, the pure reason which
has directed the German philosopher in the establishment
of critical philosophy. This right reason, being quite near
to human virtues, is still very far from Wisdom which alone
leads to Truth. Nevertheless it can reach there, ior nothing
is impossible for the Will of man, even as I have quite for-
cibly stated ὁ; but it would be necessary ior that, to make
acquisition of the divine virtues, and in the same manner
that one is raised from instinct to understanding by purifi·
cation, to pass from understanding to intelligence by per·
fection. Lysis offers the means: it is by knowledge of
oneself that he promises to lead one to this desired end;
he assuras it, he invokes the name of Pythagoras himself :

25. I nueor it by the one who in our heom engrdved
The sacred T etrod, symbol immense ond pure,
Source of Nature ond model of the Gods.
