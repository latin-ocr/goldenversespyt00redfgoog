Examinations ol the Golden Verses 231

The understanding, reacted upon by the intelligenoe, be
comes reason: it oonoeiveslof opinions so much the more
just, as its passions are the more calm. Reason cannot by

. its own movement attain to wisdom and find truth, because

being placed in the middle of a sphere and forced from there,
it describes, from the centretothe circumferenoe,aray always
straight and subordinate to the point of departure, it has
against it infinity, that is to say, that truth being one, and
residing in a single point of the circumference, it cannot be
the subject of reason, only as far as it is known beforehand,
and as reason is placed in the direction convenient for its
encounter. Intelligenoe, which can only put reason in
this direction by the assent that it gives at the point oi

primordial Ternary in its unity, and which determines the
action of each of its iaculties according to its own mode·
without the will it would have no existence. The three
faculties by which the volitive unity is manifested in the
triple Ternary, are memory, judgment, and imagination.
These three laculties, acting in a homogeneous unity, have
neither height nor depth and do not affect one ol the modi·
fications of the being, any more than another; they are all
wherever the will ie, and the will operatos freely in the intel·
ligence or in the understanding; in the understanding or in
the instinct: where it wills to be there it is; its iacrrlties
follow it everywhere. I say that it is wherever it wills to
be when the being is wholly developed; for following the
course ol Nature, it is first in the instinct and only passos
into the understanding and into the intelligence successively
and in proportion as the animistic and spiritual iaculties
are developed. But in order that this development may
take place, the will must determine it; for without the will
