The Essenceand Form ol Poetry 43

Yon recall, Messieurs, that wishing, with Chaneellor
Baoon, to distinguish the essenoe and the form of
Poetry, 1 have taken my text from the works of Plato. It
is again irorn this man, justly called divine even by his
rivals, from the founder ol the Academy, that I have bor-
rowed the germ oi my idea. This philosopher compares
the effect which the real poets have upon those who hear
thern, with the magnetic stone which not only attracts
rings oi iron, but communicates to them also the virtue of
attracting other rings.¹

In order to appreciate well the force of this thought, and
to follow all the inferenoes, it is necessary to state a truth
de sacto: namely, that the men destined by Providence to
regenerate the world, in whatever manner it may be, to
open any sort ol a career, are extremely rare. Nature,
docile to the impulse which she has received of bringing all
to perlection by means oi time, elaborates slowly the ele-
ments of their genius, places them at great distances upon
the earth, and makes them appear at epochs very far re·
moved one from the other. Itis necessary that these
events, which determine these men toward an end, should
be brought about in advance; that the physical conditions
in which they are born coincide with the inspiration which
attends them; and therefore everything prepareS, every-
thing protects, everything serves the providential design.
These men, thus scattered over the earth, come among
nations to form them, to give thern laws, to enlighten and
to instruct them. They arethe bencon-lights of mankind,
these are those to whom Ι attribute the first inspiration.
