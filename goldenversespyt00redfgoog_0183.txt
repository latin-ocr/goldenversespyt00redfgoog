jected. The most orthodox Hebrews,and those even who
passed as seers or propheta oi the nation, had no difficulty
in attributing to God the cause ol Evil‘ They were ob-

viously authoriaed by the history of the downfall oi the
first man, and by the dogma ol original sin, which they took
according to the meaning attached to it by the vulgar. It

say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, 1 come against
thee, and Ι will draw forth my sword out ol its sheath, and will cut oli in thee

‘Mohammed said oi himself, that he possessed no heavenly treasures,
that he was ignorant oi the mysteries, that he could say nothing oi the essence
ol the soul (Koron, ch. 6 and 17); and as he admitted the literal text ol the
