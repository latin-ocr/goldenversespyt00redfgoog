Examinations of the Golden Verses 141

beg the reader to observe. Moses, instructed in the same
school as Pythagoras, after having announced the Unity of
God in the famous Decalogue which contains the summary
of his law, and having commanded its adoration to his
people, announces for the first virtue, filial piety⁰: “Hon-
our,'' he said, “thy father and thy mother, that thy days
may be multiplied in this country of Adam, that Jhdah,
thy Gods, has given thee.’'⁶

The theocratic legislator of the Hebrews in making this
commandment places recompense by the side of precept τ,
he declares formally that the exercise of filial piety draws
with it a long existence. Now, it must be remarked that
Moses being content with enclosing in his doctrine the sole
purgative part, doubtless judging his people not in a condi·
tion to support the unitive part, spoke to them nowhere
of the immortality which is its consequence; content-
ing himself with promising the joys of temporal blessings,
among which he carefully placed in the first rank a long
life. Experience has proved, relative to people in general,¹

always on that which is attached to the name of Adam, whence it is derived.

it well enough by Emnal. It is Eternity, or the Thnewitlnuthimit of
Zoroaster. This name is quite generally followed, as it is here, with the words
*trba (Melit-cho), thy Gods, in order to express that the Unity contained in
Jhoah, comprehends the infinity of the gods, and takes the place of it with
the people of lsrael.
