166 The Golden Verses ol Pythagoras

ollends him? ⁰

The evangelical precept paraphrased by Hafiz is found in

substance in a discourse of Lysias; it is clearly expreseed by
Thales and Pittacus; Kong-Tse taught it in the same words
as Jesus; finally one finds in the Aryo‚ written more than
three centuries before our era, these lines which seem made
expressly to inculcate the maxim and depict the death oi
the righteous man:

The duty ol a good man, even at the moment oi his destruc·
tion, consists not only in forgiving but even in a desire of bene-
fiting his destroyer; as the sundal-trae, in the instant oi its
overthrow sheds perfume on the ax which fells; and he would
triumph in repeating the verse of Sadi who represents a return
ol good lor good as a slight reciprocity‚ but says to the virtuous
man, ‘¹ conier benefits on him who has injured thee.” ⁶

Interrogata the peoples from the Boreal pole to the
extremities of Asia, and ask them what they think of virtue:
they will respond to you, as Zen0, that it is all that is good
and beautiful; the Scandinavians, disciples ol Odin‚ will
show you the anamot sublime discourse ol their ancient
legislator, wherein hospitality, charity, justice, and courage
are expressly commended to them : You will know by
tradition that the Celts had the sacred verses oi their
Druids, wherein piety, justice, and valour were celebrated
as national virtues⁶; you will see in the books preserved

bL'Arya, cite comme cidessus:

'‘L'homme de bien, paisable au moment qu'il expire,
Toume sur ses bourreaux un oeil religieux,
Et benit jusqu'au bras qui cause son martyre:
Tel l'arhre de Sandal que trappe un lurieux,
Couvre de ses partums le ler qui le dechire.''
