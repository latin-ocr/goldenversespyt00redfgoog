146 The Golden Verses of Pythagoras

was that of the ancient Egyptians, among whom Pythagoras
had imbibedit. “Manis mortal with reference to the body,'’
they said, “but he is immortal with reference to the soul
which constitutes essential man. As immortal he has
authority over all things; but relative to the material and

One can see by these few words that the ancient sages
did not give to Destiny the universal influence that certain
philosophers and particularly the Stoics gave to it later on;
but they considered it only as exercising its empire over

of the Porch had defined it as a chain of causes, by virtue
of which the past has taken place, the present exists, and
the future is to be realized⁶; or still better, as the rule of
the law by which the Universe is govemed⁶; one must
believe, 1 say, that these philosophers confounded Destiny
with Providence‚ and did not distinguish the effect from

fundamental law of which destiny is but an emanation.
This confusion of words> had to produce and in fact did
produce, among the Stoics, an inversion of ideas which was

forced, and thereafter indifferent in themselves, so that
good and evil, virtue and vice, are vain words, things whose
existence is purely ideal and relative.

The Stoics would have evaded these calamitous results
if, like Pythagoras, they had admitted the two motives
of which Ι have spoken, Necessity and Power; and if, far
from instituting Necessity alone as absolute master of the
