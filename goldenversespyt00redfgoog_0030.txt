The Essence and Form ol Poetry 7

§1

When, alter the revival ol letters in Europe, Chaucellor
Baoon, legislator of thought, sketched with bold strokos the
tree ol human knowledge, and brought back each branch
ol scienoe to that ol the moral laculties upon which it de-
pends, he did not fail to observe sagaciously that it was
necessary to distingnish in poetry two things, its essenoe
and its lorm¹t its essenceaspertaining whollytothe rmagrna

branchos of scienoe¹3 its form, as making part ol the gram·

into the rational faculty ol the understanding.³ This
celebrated man had borrowed this idea from a man much
older and more celebrated than himself, Plato. According
to this admirable philosopher, poetry is either a simple
talent, an art which one uses to give to his own ideas a

particular form, or it is a divine inspiration by means ol ·

to men the ideas of the gods,⁴ It is because, never having
felt sufficiently this important distinction and having oon·

the torm of poetry, which are as the soul and body ol this
science, that so many men among the modern nations pro
claimed themselves poets, whereas they were, in strict truth,
only elever versifiers. For it does not suffice, as Plato

verse and even good verse, to be called a poete it is neces·
sary to possess that divine enthusiasm, that inspiration
which elevatas the soul, enlightens it, transports it, as it

to be on this point. He agrees that verse alone does not constitute poetry,
and that the History ol Herodotus, put into verse, would never be other
than history.
