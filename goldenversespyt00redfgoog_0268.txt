Examinations os the Golden Verses 245

whose contemplation must make his happiness, the less he
can communicate the knowledge of it to others; sor truth,
coming to him under intelligible forms more and more uni·

human Quatemary, they were ignorant of the manner in

themselves nearly always under the oddest and most absurd
forms, have taken them by passing from his intelligence to
his instinct, without his reason having had the forcetooppose
itself. This 1s how he artlessly expresses this transformation
