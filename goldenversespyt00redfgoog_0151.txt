' 128 The Golden Verses of Pythagoras

Guard then thy saith:

Pythagoras, of whom a modern savant, otherwise most
estimable, has rather throughtlessly reproached with being
a fanatical and superstitious man,⁰ begins his teaching,
nevertheless, by laying down a principle of universal toler-
ance. He commands his disciples to follow the cult estab-
lished by the laws, whatever this cult may he, and to adore
the gods of their country, what ever these gods may he;
enjoining them only, to guard afterwards their faith-that
is, to remain inwardly faithful to his doctrine, and never to
divulge the mysteries. Lysis, in writing these opening
lines, adroitly conceals herein a double meaning. By the
first he commended, as Ι have said, tolerance and reserve
for the Pythagorean, and, following the example of the
Egyptian priests, established two doctrines, the one apparent
and vulgar, conformable to the law; the other mysterious
and secret, analogous to the faith; by the second meaning,
he reassures the suspicions people of Greeoe‚ who, according
to the slanders which were in circulation might have feared
that the new sect would attack the sanctity of their gods.
This tolerance on the one hand, and this reserve on the other,
were no more than what they would be today. The Chris-
tian Religion, exclusive and severe, has changed all our ideas
in this respect: by admitting only one sole doctrine in one
unique ehurch, this religion has necessarily confused toler-
ance with indifference or coldness, and reserve with heresy
or hypocrisy; but in the spirit of polytheism these same
things take on another colour. A Christian philosopher
could not, without perjuring himself and committing a
frightful impiety, bend the knee in China before Kong-Tse,
nor offer incense to Chong-Ty nor to Tien,· he could neither
