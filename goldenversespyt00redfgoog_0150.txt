Examinations of the Golden Verses 127

had made it known. The disciples of a great man had no
other name than his. All their works were attributed to
him. This is an observation sufficiently important to make
and which explains how Vyasa in India, Hermes in Egypt,
Orpheus in Greece, have been the supposed authors of such
a multitude of books that the lives of many men would
not even suffice to read them.

In my translation, Ι have followed the Greek text, such '

as is cited at the head oi the Commentary of Hierocles, com·
mentated on by the son oi Casaubon, and interpreted into
Latin by J. Curterius; London edition, 1673. This work,
like all those which remain to us of the ancients, has been
the subject oi a great many critical and grammatical discus·
sions: in the first place one must before everything else be
assured oi the material part. This part is today as authen·
tic and as correct as it is possible to be, and although there
exists still, several different readings, they are oi too little
importanoe forme to dwell upon. Itis not my aflair and
besides, chacun doit faire son metior. That oi the gramma·
rian has ended where it ought to end. For how can man
ever expect to advance ii he never is willing to try some new
thing which is offered. I shall not therefore ‚make any
criticizing remarks concerning the text, ior Ι consider this
text sufficiently examined; neither will Ι make any notes
concerning the Commentaries, properly so·called, on these
seventy·one lines, for I think it is sufficient having those ol
Hierocles, of Vitus Amerbachius, Theodore Marcilius,
Henri Brem, Michel Neander, Jean Straselius, Guilhaume
Dienius, Magnus-Daniel Omeis, Andre Dacier, etc. As 1
stated, Ι shall make examinations rather than commentarios,
and I will give, regarding the inner meaning ol the Verses,
all the explanations that I believe useful ior their complete
development.
