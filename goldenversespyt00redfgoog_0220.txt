Examinations ol the Golden Verses 197

“As the flame of a torch tends always upward whichever
way one turns it‚” said the Indian sages, “thus the man
whose heart is afire with virtue, whatever accident befalls
him, directs himself always toward the end that wisdom
indicatos.”l

“Misfortune follows vice, and happiness virtue‚'’ said
the Chinese‚ “as the echo follows the voice and the shadow
him who moves.”⁶

Ο virtue! divine virtue! [exclaims Kong-Tse‘] a celestial
power presents thee to us, an interior force conducts us toward
thee; happy the mortal in whom thou dwellest! he strikes the
goal without ellort, a single glance suffices for him to penetrate
the truth. His heart becomes the sanctuary of peace and his
very inclinations protect his innocense. It is granted to the sage
only, to attain to so desirable a state. He who aspires to this
must resolve upon the good and attach himself strongly to it;
he must apply himself to the study of himself, interrogate nature,
examine all things carefully, meditate upon thern and allow
nothing to pass unfathomed. Let him develop the faculties of
his soul‚ let him thinlr with force, let him put energy and firmness
into bis actions. Alasl how many men there are who seek virtue
and science, and who stop in the middle of their course, because
the goal keeps thern waiting! My studies, they say, leave me
with all my ignorance‚ all my doubts; my efforts, my labours
enlarge neither my views nor my sagacity; the same clouds hover
over my understanding and obscure it; I feel my forces abandon-
ing me and my will giving way beneath the weight of the obstacle.
No matter; guard yourself against discouragement; that which
others have been able to attain at the first attempt, you may be
able at the hundredtb; that which they have done at the hund·
redth, you will do at the thousandth!
