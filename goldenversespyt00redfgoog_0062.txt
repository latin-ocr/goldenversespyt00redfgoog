The Essence and Form ol Poetry 39

tion, and this observation will be somewhat novel: it is
that, the poetic inspiration being once received by the poet
and his soul finding itsell transported into the intelligible
world, all the ideas which then come to him are universal
andin consequence allegorical. So that nothing true may
exist outside ol unity, and as everything that is true is one
and homogeneous, it is found that, although the poet gives
to his ideas a lonn determined in the sentient world, this
form agrees with a multitude ol things which, being distinct
in their species, are not so in their genus. This is why
Homer has been the man of all men, the type oi all types,
the faithful mirror,¹ wherein all ideas becoming reflected
have appeared to be created. Lycurgus read his works,
and saw there a model of his legislation.² Pericles and Alci·
biados had need of his counsels; they had recourse tohim
as a model ol statesmen.³ He was for Plato the first of the
philosophers‚ and ior Alexander the greatest ol kings; and
what is more extraordinary still, even the sectarians, divided
among themselves, were ,united in him. The Stoics spoke
only ol this great poet as a rigid follower ol the Porch⁴;
at the Academy he was considered as the creator of dialec-
ties3 at the Lyceum, the disciples of Aristotle cited him as
a zealous dogmatist⁵3 finally, the Epicureans saw in him
only a man calm and pure, who, satisfied with that tranquil
lile where one is wholly possessed by it, seeks nothing more.⁶
The temples, which devout enthusiasm consecrated to him,
were the rendczvous ior mankind.⁷ Such is the appanage
ol universal ideas: they are as the Divinity which inspires
thern, all in all, and all in the least parts.
