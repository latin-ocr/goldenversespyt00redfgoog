180 The Golden Verses 01 Pythagoras

3 case 01 returning again to the idea 01 Β3311, 31111 oi exclaim·
ing with him, that no man is without sin. Kong·Tse 1133
been unquestionably one 01 1113 greatest 13311 who 113311011-
oured the earth, and Bacon one 01 the most judicious philo-
sophers 01 Europa both have, however, committed grave
mistakes whose effect is more or less felt by posterity: the
former, filling the Chinese literati with 33 exaggerated re·
spect for antiquity, has made of itan immobile and almost
inert mass, that Providence, in order to obtain certain
necessary movements, has bad to strike many times with the
terrible scourge 01 revolutions; the latter, inspiring, on the
contrary, a thoughtluss contempt for everything that 331113
11013 the ancients, demanding the prool 01 their principles,
the reason 101 111311 dogmas, subjecting all to the light 01
experience, has broken the scientific body, has deprived it
ol unity, and 1133 113331033311 the assemblage 01 1111311313
1310 3 tumultuous anarchy from whose irregular movement
bas sprung enough violent storms. Ι1 Β3303 had been
able to effect in Europe the same influence that Kong-Tse
had effected in China, he would have drawn philosophy into
materialism and absolute empiricism. Happily the remedy
is born 01 the 3111113311. The lack 01 unity has taken away
all 10133 from the anarchical colossus. Each supposing
to be in the right, 30 033 was. A hundred systems raised
one upon the other clashed and were broken in turn. Ex-
perience, invoked by all parties has taken all colours and
its opposed judgments were seli-destructive.

Il, 31131 having called attention to the mistakes 01 111333
great men, Ι dared to hazard my opinion upon the point
where both 01 them have failed, I would say that they have
confused the principles 01 the sciences with their develop-
ments; it must be so, by drawing the principles 11031 the
past, as Kong-Tse; by allowing the developments to act
throughout the future, as Baeon. Principles hold to the
Necessity 01 things; they are immutable in themselves;
finite, inaccessible to the senses, they are proved by reason:
