240 The Golden Verses os Pythagoras

iollowers of Manes, having retired to Arabia, were raspon-
sible for these borrowings, by the opinions that they cir-
culated there. But, it must be frankly stated, this dogma,
quite in its place in the ZendAuesto, dces not appear so
consistent in the Koron, for, of what use is it in a cult where
the predestination of men, necessitated by the Presdent
and All-Powerlul Divine, delivers irresistibly the greatest
part oi them to an eternal damnation, on account of the
original stain imprinted upon mankind by the sin of the
first man? One cannot be prevented, in redecting upon this
manifest contradiction, from believing that the theosophical
tradition pertang to the free will of man, and the influ-
encing action of Providenee operating the progressive aug-
mentation of good and the gradual diminution ol evil,
announccd openly by Zoroaster, must have acted secretly
in the mind of the thcocratic legislator of Arabia. Il it
had not been thus, the prayers that he ordered as one ol the
first and most essential duties of the religion, would have
been without object.

According to the doctrine of Pythagoras revealed by
Hieroclen, two things agree in the efficacy of prayer: the
voluntary movement of our soul, and aid from heaven.
The first of these things is that which sceks goodness; and
the other that which shows it. Prayer is a medium between
our quest and the celestial gift. One seeks one prays in
vain, if one adds not prayer to research and researeh to
prayer. Virtue is an emanation from God; it is like a
reflected image of the Divinity, the resemblance ol which
alone constitutes the good and the beautiful. The soul
which is attached to this admirable type of all perfectiori
is aroused to prayer by its inclination to virtue, and it aug-
ments this inclination by the effusion of the goodness which
it receives by means of prayer; so that it does precisely
what it demands and demands what it does.‘' Socrates
was not far from the doctrine of Pythagoras in this re-
