150 The Golden Verses ol Pythagoras

never said that matter might be an absolute being whose
essence might be composed of evil. Hierocles, who had
studied the doctrine ol this great man and that of Plato,
has denied that either the one or the other had ever declared
matter as a being existing by itsell. Hebes proved, on the
contrary, that Plato taught, following the steps of Pythago-

his followers were mistaken when they thought that he
admitted an uncreated matter! Power and Necessity

are not, as has been believed, the absolute source of good
and evil. Necessity is not more evil in itsell than Power
is not good; it is from the usage that man is called to make
ol them, and from their employment which is indicated by
wisdom or ignorance, virtue or vice, that results Good or

himself, Jupiter, opening indifferently the sources of good
and evil upon the universe.

that the same thing represented by Jupiter or the Univer-
