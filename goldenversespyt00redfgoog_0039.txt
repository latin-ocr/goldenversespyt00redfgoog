16 The Golden Verses ol Pythagoras

resided upon a mormtain that d'Anville believes he has
recognized, between Moldavia and Transylvania. The
Thracians had also a sovereign pontid instituted in the

same manner as that of the Getae, and residing likewise

upon a sacred mountain* It was, no doubt, from the
heights of these mountains that the divine eracles, the laws

and teachings which the great pontifis had composedin

verse, were at first spread throughout Graece; so that it

might be said, literally as well as figuratively, that poetry,
pevered as the language oi the gods, production of anhhernd

Being, desoended from the ethereal abode and was propa·

gated upon earth for the instruction and delight ol mortals.

It appears to me very certain that the temple oi Delphi,
erected upon the famous mountain ol Parnassus, diflered

tradition, it was Olen who, coming out from Lycia, that is

to say from the light, caused all Greece to recognize the

cult of Apollo and Diana; composed the hymns which were
chanted at Delos in honour ol these two divinities and estab-

lished the temple oi Delphi of which he was the first pontiff.¹

Thus the temple oi Delphi rivalled those of Thrace. Its
foundation, doubtless due to some innovator priest, was

Ι attributed by a poetic metaphor to the divinity which had

Ι ’·’ were formed, that oi the Thracians consecrated to Bacchus
, and Ceres, or Dionysus the divine spirit, and Demeter the
